Recent neural network approaches such as Doc2Vec and its variants are popular. Regarding its comparison with traditional representation methods such as the TF-IDF method, the results are not very conclusive due to several factors-- Doc2vec has many hyper-parameters, resulting in performance fluctuation; traditional methods have space to improve. More importantly, document length and data size have impacts on the result. This thesis conducts a comparative study of these methods, and propose to improve the TF-IDF weighting with mutual information(MI). We find that Doc2vec works good only for short documents, and only when the data size (the number of documents) is large. For long documents and small data size, MI performs better. The experiments are conducted extensively on 11 data sets that are of a variety of combinations of document length and data size. In addition, we study the relationship between TF-IDF and MI weighting. We find that their correlation is high overall (Pearson correlation coefficient is over 0.9 on all the data sets used in our thesis). For medium frequency words, the MI weighting is always smaller than the TF-IDF weighting. However, for rare words and popular words, MI diverges from TF-IDF greatly, and the weighting of MI is higher than TF-IDF for popular words but lower than TF-IDF for rare words", "datePublished": "2019-01-01T08:00:00", "publisher": "'University of Windsor Leddy Library'", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/286641345.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/286641345.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/286641345", "https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/etd/8183", "https://scholar.uwindsor.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9235&amp;context=etd"]}, {"authors": ["Montllonch Araquistain, Tatiana"], "title": "TIDAL POWER: Economic and Technological Assessment", "description": "At present time there is concern over global climate change, as well as a growing awareness on worldwide population about the need on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This in fact, has led to an increase in power generation from renewable sources. Tidal energy has the potential to play a valuable role in a sustainable energy future. Its main advantage over other renewable sources is its predictability; tides can be predicted years in advanced. The energy extracted from the tides can come from both, the vertical movements of the water associated with the rise and fall, potential energy, and from the kinetic energy, namely, tidal currents. A tidal barrage harnesses the potential energy while tidal stream turbines capture the energy from tidal currents. This thesis reviews the physical principles of tidal energy considering gravitational effects of sun and moon; semidiurnal, diurnal and mixed tides, and periodic phenomena that affect tidal range. Moreover, an up-to-date review of the status of tidal energy technology is included. Furthermore, the different tidal conversion systems are introduced, tidal barrage and tidal stream turbines. The current issues for both technologies are presented, aiming to place the reader on the current situation. The thesis also contains an economic assessment, where the current costs of both technologies as well as an estimation of the future costs are shown. The levelised costs of energy (LCOE), which measure the cost of the generated electricity, are also calculated and compared. From this chapter it is concluded, that although tidal current has very high costs, it has a clear potential to become competitive with other generation forms in the future as costs will considerably decrease as the installed capacity increases. On the other hand it is said that although tidal barrage is a mature technology has very high costs, however its deployment can bring several benefits. Finally a technological report is included. The purpose of it is to identify which technology, one direction or two-direction turbines, can generate more electricity under the same operating conditions. It also includes a cost analysis of both types of devices. The conclusion raised considering the electricity generated as well as the technology costs is that bi-directional devices have lower energy costs.Outgoin", "datePublished": "2010-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Tsinghua University Press'", "subjects": ["Master thesis (pre-Bologna period)"], "year": 2010, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/41805299.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41805299.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/41805299", "http://hdl.handle.net/2099.1/14731"]}, {"authors": ["Atkinson, David", "Burig, Douglas", "Canellas, Marc", "Wagner, Alan"], "title": "Autonomous Systems & Domestic Security", "datePublished": "2020-04-20T01:42:45", "publisher": "Penn State Law eLibrary", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/322529905.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322529905.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/322529905", "https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=jlia", "https://elibrary.law.psu.edu/jlia/vol7/iss3/5"]}, {"authors": ["Pozzi, Isabella", "Boht\u00e9, Sander", "Roelfsema, Pieter"], "title": "A Biologically Plausible Learning Rule for Deep Learning in the Brain", "description": "Researchers have proposed that deep learning, which is providing important\nprogress in a wide range of high complexity tasks, might inspire new insights\ninto learning in the brain.

The purpose of the study was to learn about my practice through critically reflecting on how my personal history, experiences, practical theory and assumptions influenced my role as facilitator and to learn about my practice through the reflected gaze of workshop participants. Data were derived from three sets of daily journals from three workshops and from one focus group interview. I separated the quotes from each workshop into two sets, the participants\u2019 description of their own learning experience and their perceptions of me, the facilitator. I proceeded through the transcripts sequentially according to the date of the workshop. The transcripts were analyzed using a phenomenological approach. I built the themes as I progressed and gained a better sense of what the workshop participants were saying. I used all their quotations. I checked my analysis with research groups three times, and each time it helped me refine the themes. Two sets of themes emerged from the data describing participants\u2019 perceptions of their experience and their perceptions of the facilitator. The theme, learning in a safe environment forms the ground for both sets of themes. It describes the importance of safety and the critical role of the facilitator in creating a safe environment. A safe environment is vital for teachers to take risks in learning and to critically examine their learning and teaching. Facilitators have many roles; the participants described four roles. Creator of a safe learning environment, with four themes characterizes the facilitating role to create an environment where workshop participants can feel accepted, voice their thoughts easily, become a community of learners and realize that it is diversity that contributes to their learning. The role of expert is about the knowledge, skill and experience of the facilitator, which contributes to learning. The role of storyteller helps workshop participants make connections between practice and theory and how stories aid in bringing clarity to understanding. The role of role model is about learning from the actions and behavior of the facilitator.\nThis study shows the significant and multidimensional role of the facilitator in building a learning environment that is non-threatening: where learning can be shared; learning is a collaborative endeavor; is highly interactive and promotes critical self reflection even in settings where there is diversity amongst participants", "datePublished": "2005-05-01T07:00:00", "publisher": "TRACE: Tennessee Research and Creative Exchange", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2005, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/268768342.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268768342.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/268768342", "https://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/2319", "https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3872&amp;context=utk_graddiss"]}, {"authors": ["Dang Thi Phuong Chung", "Dinh Van Tai"], "title": "A fruits recognition system based on a modern deep learning technique", "description": "The popular technology used in this innovative era is Computer vision for fruit recognition.

Deep learning can automatically capture the intricate structure of user preferences by encoding learned feature representations from high dimensional data.\nIn this thesis, we explore five novel applications of deep learning-based techniques to address top-n recommendation. First, we propose Collaborative Memory Network, which unifies the strengths of the latent factor model and neighborhood-based methods inspired by Memory Networks to address collaborative filtering with implicit feedback. Second, we propose Neural Semantic Personalized Ranking, a novel probabilistic generative modeling approach to integrate deep neural network with pairwise ranking for the item cold-start problem. Third, we propose Attentive Contextual Denoising Autoencoder augmented with a context-driven attention mechanism to integrate arbitrary user and item attributes. Fourth, we propose a flexible encoder-decoder architecture called Neural Citation Network, embodying a powerful max time delay neural network encoder augmented with an attention mechanism and author networks to address context-aware citation recommendation. Finally, we propose a generic framework to perform conversational movie recommendations which leverages transfer learning to infer user preferences from natural language. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of all five proposed models against competitive baseline methods and demonstrate the successful adaptation of deep learning-based techniques to the recommendation domain", "datePublished": "2019-06-01T07:00:00", "publisher": "Scholar Commons", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/223093910.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/223093910.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/223093910", "https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/eng_phd_theses/22", "https://scholarcommons.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=eng_phd_theses"]}, {"authors": ["COOK, HENRI"], "title": "Promoting Informal Learning Using a Context-Sensitive Recommendation Algorithm For a QRCode-based Visual Tagging System", "description": "Structured Abstract\n\n\n\nContext: Previous work in the educational field has demonstrated that Informal Learning is an effective way to learn. Due to its casual nature it is often difficult\n\nfor academic institutions to leverage this method of learning as part of a typical curriculum.\n\n\n\nAim: This study planned to determine whether Informal Learning could be encouraged amongst learners at Durham University using an object tagging system and a context-sensitive recommendation algorithm. \n\n\n\nMethod: This study creates a visual tagging system using a type of two-dimensional barcode called the QR Code and describes a tool designed to allow learners to use these \u2018tags\u2019 to learn about objects in a physical space. Information about objects features audio media as well as textual descriptions to make information appealing.\n\nA collaboratively-filtered, user-based recommendation algorithm uses elements of a learner\u2019s context, namely their university records, physical location and data on\n\nthe activities of users similar to them to create a top-N ranked list of objects that they may find interesting. The tool is evaluated in a case study with thirty (n=30) participants taking part in a task in a public space within Durham University. The evaluation uses quantitative and qualititative data to make conclusions as to the use\n\nof the proposed tool for individuals who wish to learn informally.\n\n\n\nResults: A majority of learners found learning about the objects around them to be an interesting practice. The recommendation system fulfilled its purpose and\n\nlearners indicated that they would travel a significant distance to view objects that were presented to them. The addition of audio clips to largely textual information\n\ndid not serve to increase learner interest and the implementation of this part of the system is examined in detail. Additionally there was found to be no apparent\n\ncorrelation between prior computer usage and the ability to comprehend an informal learning tool such as the one described.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Context-sensitive, mobile tools are valuable for motivating Informal Learning. Interaction with tagged objects outside of the experimental setting\n\nindicates significant learner interest even from those individuals that did not participate in the study. Learners that did participate in the experiment gained a better\n\nunderstanding of the world around them than they would have without the tool and would use such software again in the future", "datePublished": "2010-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2010, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/85672.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/85672.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/85672", "http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/463/1/thesis.pdf", "http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/463/"]}, {"authors": ["Irwan, Zildawarni", "Mohd Akhir, Noor Erni Fazlina", "Rani, Norhamimah", "Zakaria, Noorul Huda"], "title": "Analyzing students\u2019 perception towards higher education amenities in a public university in Terengganu / Zildawarni Irwan \u2026 [et al.]", "description": "Provision of quality services is one of the most important priorities in higher education institutions.

The ubiquity and the poor quality of low-fee private schools in India and other developing countries are well-researched subjects. Studies have also shown that parents from low-income households in these countries are increasingly enrolling their children in these schools. However, not much research has been done on the subset of low-fee private schools that provide good quality education in spite of the financial and systemic challenges associated with such schools. This qualitative case study aims to understand how one such low-fee private school in Chennai, India works to provide good quality early childhood education (ECE).\r\n\r\nThe case study was guided by five theoretical propositions and two rival propositions which were based on established conceptual frameworks such as Rowan\u2019s (1997) \u2018teachers\u2019 effectiveness framework,\u2019 Hallinger\u2019s (2011) \u2018leadership for learning model,\u2019 and distributed leadership. The study relied on three types of data sets to help triangulate the findings: (1) classroom observation notes and the rating of the ECE environment using the Tamil Nadu Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (TECERS); (2) semi-structured, in-depth interviews with four preprimary teachers and four school leaders; and (3) relevant documents such as lesson plans used by the preprimary teachers and various webpages from the school\u2019s website.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the study validated the theoretical propositions while invalidating the rival propositions. The results point to two key drivers of the good quality ECE in the case study school: (1) motivated and capable teachers, and (2) a distributed school leadership that was focused on learning. The findings also brought out the critical role of the school leadership in creating an enabling school culture and in building teacher capacity. Furthermore, the findings validate the conceptual frameworks in the context of low-fee private schools in urban India. However, acknowledging that the findings could have local relevance, further research is recommended in other low-fee private schools in diverse contexts to understand their universal applicability across low-fee private schools in India and other developing countries", "datePublished": "2019-08-15T00:00:00", "publisher": "University of Oulu", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis", "info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/344906997.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/344906997.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/344906997", "http://jultika.oulu.fi/Record/nbnfioulu-201908172772"]}, {"authors": ["Mohr, Erica"], "title": "Be More: Buffering Against Gender Stereotypes by Building Self-Efficacy Beliefs", "description": "Research shows that organizations perform better when women are represented on senior leadership teams.

However, the loading and unloading of goods in the ports, the related ship traffic, and the hinterland distribution can cause a number of negative environmental impacts.\n\nIn this thesis, the concepts of environmental aspects and indicators are reviewed, as two relevant elements used in the environmental management. The importance of both elements within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise that the identification of environmental aspects and the use of indicators are essential processes, they do not specify any methodology to undertake these tasks. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already identified their significant aspects and performance indicators, most of these ports do not use any standardized method. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports may not necessarily be science-based, systematic in approach or appropriate for the purpose of implementing effective environmental management.\n\nFor these reasons, it was detected that a new methodology able to identify port' aspects and their most adequate indicators was needed. The developed methodology is called EPORTS.CAT and it comprises two main tools: a Tool for the identification and assessment of Environmental Aspects in Ports (TEAP) and a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP). The first aims at the identification of the major environmental aspects that may be generated in a port and the assessment of their significance (TEAP); and the second at the identification of performance indicators that are related with the aspects and the provision of guidelines for their implementation (TEIP).\n\nThis method has been developed after analysing the strengths, weaknesses and challenges of the existing techniques, the recommendations from the Environmental Management System (EMS) standards and the advice of specialists. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user (i.e. port environmental manager). This new\n\nmethodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. EPORTS.CAT is a practical and time-saving tool for port managers to easily determine significant aspects and indicators in their port areas.\u00c9s \u00e0mpliament reconegut que els ports s\u00f3n crucials per al desenvolupament econ\u00f2mic de les \u00e0rees del seu entorn. No obstant, la c\u00e0rrega i desc\u00e0rrega de mercaderies en els ports, el tr\u00e0fic de vaixells, aix\u00ed com la distribuci\u00f3 de mercaderies cap a l\u2019interior poden causar una s\u00e8rie d\u2019impactes ambientals negatius. En aquesta tesi s\u2019analitzen els conceptes d\u2019aspecte i indicador ambientals, que s\u00f3n dos elements rellevants utilitzats en la gesti\u00f3 ambiental. Tamb\u00e9 es justifica la import\u00e0ncia que tenen tots dos elements dins d\u2019un Sistema de Gesti\u00f3 Ambiental (SGA). Encara que les normes dels SGA reconeixen que la identificaci\u00f3 dels aspectes ambientals i l'\u00fas d'indicadors s\u00f3n processos essencials, no especifiquen cap metodologia per a realitzar aquestes tasques. A m\u00e9s, la recerca duta a terme en aquesta tesi demostra que, si b\u00e9 hi ha un alt percentatge de ports europeus que ja han identificat els seus aspectes significatius i indicadors, la majoria d'aquests ports no utilitzen cap m\u00e8tode estandarditzat. Aix\u00f2 suggereix que alguns dels procediments utilitzats pels ports poden no tenir necess\u00e0riament una base cient\u00edfica, o b\u00e9, no ser sistem\u00e0tics o apropiats per al prop\u00f2sit d\u2019implementar una correcta gesti\u00f3 ambiental. Per aquestes raons, es va detectar que era necess\u00e0ria una nova metodologia capa\u00e7 d'identificar aspectes ambientals en ports i els seus indicadors m\u00e9s adequats. La metodologia desenvolupada es diu EPORTS.CAT i consta de dues eines principals: la Tool for the identification and assessment of Environmental Aspects in Ports (TEAP) i la Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP). La primera t\u00e9 per objectiu identificar els principals aspectes ambientals que poden generar-se en un port i avaluar-ne la seva significan\u00e7a (TEAP); i la segona identificar els indicadors que estan relacionats amb els aspectes i proveir de directrius per a la seva correcta aplicaci\u00f3 (TEIP). Aquest m\u00e8tode ha estat desenvolupat despr\u00e9s d'analitzar els punts forts i febles de les t\u00e8cniques existents, les recomanacions de les normes dels Sistemes de Gesti\u00f3 Ambiental (SGA) i l\u2019assessorament d\u2019especialistes.

This paper discusses the comparison of the simulation results to see interoperability of multiplatform MPLS VPN andreliability through traffic engineering using RSVP-TE and LDP protocols. Both the RSVP and LDP protocols are tested on a stable network and in a recovery mode,as well as non-load conditions and with additional traffic load. The recovery mode is the condition after the failover due to termination of one of the links in the network. The no-load condition means that the network is not filled with additional traffic. There is only traffic from the measurement activity itself. While network conditions with an additional load are conditions where there is an additional UDP packet traffic load of 4.5 Mbps in addition to the measurement load itself. On a stable network and without additional traffic load, the average delay on LDP protocol is 59.41 ms, 2.06 ms jitter, 0.08% packetloss, and 8.99 Mbps throughput. Meanwhile, on RSVP protocol, the average delay is 52.40 ms, 2.39 ms jitter, 12.18% packet loss, and 7.80 Mbps throughput.

In\nthis paper, we develop a method for human activity recognition that tackles\nthese two issues. In the proposed method, an activity is divided into several\nsuccessive actions represented by spatio temporal patterns, and the evolution\nof these actions are captured by a sequential model. A refined comprehensive\nspatio temporal graph is utilized to represent a single action, which is a\nqualitative representation of a human action incorporating both the spatial and\ntemporal relations of the participant objects.

Women hold themselves back when they respond to these low self-efficacy beliefs, by not aspiring, not applying, not asking, and not acting. This paper explores current leadership gap data and the consequences of the disparity between men and women in leadership roles. Next, the paper describes how stereotypes can create the underlying problem: limiting internal beliefs. This paper proposes an evidence-based solution drawn from the field of positive psychology.

Marching band was used in this study because the activity often requires resources that go above and beyond what many administrators, parents, and some directors claim justifiable.   \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this causal-comparative study was to examine the effects that resources, financial and otherwise, have on directors\u2019 decisions to participate in marching band competitions.  High school marching bands from across the United States were compared to determine the amount of finances and resources invested by each program.

This study set in Indonesia sought to explore the washback influence of the national examination system on the attitudes, behaviours and motivations of teachers, learners and parents (Pearson, 1998). Previous studies on national examination in Indonesia had explored the concept without paying sufficient attention to the context and culture within which washback takes place; a culture where examination corruption remains professionally unacknowledged but all too often remains part of practice.\n\nUsing an interpretivist paradigm this study explored the perceptions of the experiences of teachers, learners and parents involved in the national examination system and identified its washback effect. In particular it explored ways in which the national examination affected teaching and learning practices in final year classrooms that in Indonesia are dominated by the national examination cycle. Finally, the study investigated how students\u2018 experiences in the national examination year might be improved.\n\nThe evidence emerging from the thematic analysis of interviews with eight English teachers, ten parents and focus group discussions with 29 final year students attending junior secondary schools identified three main washback themes. The national examination had influenced participants\u2018 feelings, their perceptions and their practices. All participating groups had participants who reported a wide range of feelings about their experiences of national examination, from neutral feelings to high levels of anxiety. The analysis also indicated that participants in each group had recognised both the positive and negative washback effects of national examination. The use of the examination for selection purposes was perceived to motivate students to learn. However, the findings also suggested that the national examination was considered by members of each group to assess students in ways that were regarded as unfair. All three groups showed how the examination influenced their role and practices as teachers, students and parents. However, although members of both parental and pupil communities made reference to a number of corrupt practices, no teacher acknowledged such practice focusing only on the more conventional washback effects of curriculum narrowing and rehearsal pedagogy.\n\nThe evidence from this study was used to extend a model of the relationship between learning and assessment theory proposed by Baird, et.al. (2017). Only when there is an adequate consideration of the culture within which these theories emerge can there be potential for these theories to have traction in offering a lens through which to interrogate practice. Finding ways to engage with features of Indonesian school culture including anxiety, religion, family expectations, corruption, gender inequality and collectivism is a central part of understanding the nature of national examination washback. Without a deeper understanding and acceptance of the problem, Indonesia, and other countries in similar circumstances, is likely to remain in a cycle of constant innovation with little meaningful, constructive change in the assessment process", "datePublished": "2020-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/323052925.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/323052925.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/323052925", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/81300/", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/81300/1/2020PuspitasariPhD.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["The Palmas Academy (2827679)"], "title": "Requirements for Admission The Palmas Academy.pdf", "description": "Located in the pristine resort area of Palmas Del Mar on the East end of the island, The Palmas Academy is an English language school with an emphasis on Science and Math in its curriculum and advanced biology, computer and science labs.

However, scant attention has been paid to investigating the implementation of sustainable supply management (SSM) practices from the perspective of multi-tier suppliers located in a developing country context. To address this knowledge gap, this study examines why and how Bangladeshi multi-tier apparel suppliers implement SSM practices in GSCs. This study is positioned within an interpretivist paradigm and employs qualitative research methodology, drawing on data from interviews with 7 owners and 39 managers of Bangladeshi multi-tier apparel suppliers and their 15 key stakeholders.\r\nThis thesis contains three empirical findings chapters. The first chapter investigates the factors that drive or hinder multi-tier suppliers\u2019 implementation of SSM practices, drawing on integrative stakeholder theory, institutional theory and contingency theory. The findings suggest that buyers\u2019 requirements, increased factory productivity and external stakeholder expectations are key drivers for multi-tier suppliers to embed SSM practices. Conversely, cost and resource concerns, and gaps in the regulatory framework are dominant barriers encountered by multi-tier suppliers in the effective implementation of SSM practices.\r\nThe second chapter examines how institutional pressures and mechanisms affect the implementation of SSM practices across multi-tier suppliers, and why these suppliers decouple implementation practices. Drawing on institutional theory, the findings indicate that institutional pressures and mechanisms \u2013 coercive, mimetic and normative \u2013 vary across multi-tier suppliers, thereby affecting their divergent implementation of SSM practices. However, managers and owners of multi-tier suppliers apply three key decoupling approaches \u2013 avoidance, defiance and manipulation \u2013 in response to institutional pressures. Specifically, the findings suggest a multiplicity of logics across multi-tier suppliers, which conflict with or complement each other during the SSM implementation process.\r\nThe third chapter investigates how multi-tier apparel suppliers integrate social and environmental issues to improve SSM outcomes. The findings suggest that multi-tier apparel suppliers are implementing various social and environmental practices to improve SSM outcomes. Although the level of implementation of sustainability practices is high within first-tier suppliers, second-tier and third-tier suppliers either adopt specific social practices on an ad hoc basis or symbolically implement environmental practices.\r\nReflecting on the overall findings, this study contributes to theory by offering a series of research propositions and expounding a holistic SSM implementation framework for multi-tier suppliers. In addition, this study provides significant implications for practitioners including factory owners, managers, and policy makers who seek to implement SSM practices in GSCs.

Over the last 10 years, sequencing has created a paradigm shift in biological sciences where more and more a component of research involves \"just sequence it\".  This is because the types of data, applications and resulting insights are expanding every year.  Further, the volume and speed of data generation are growing exponentially, while the costs to generate these data are decreasing exponentially.  The Human Genome Project completed the first draft genome sequence in 2001 at an estimated cost of $3 billion.  Next-generation sequencing became mainstream around 2007 and enabled the re-sequencing of a human genome at a cost of approximately $50,000.  In late 2015, Illumina announced the availability of their X10 sequencer for use on non-human samples enabling the re-sequencing of a mammalian (human, cow, dog etc.) genome for approximately $1,500 and with an annual throughput of 10,000 genomes per year.  The ease, rapidity and cost effectiveness of generating sequence data has created a computational analysis bottleneck.  The growth of computational resources on the MU campus has not kept pace with the growth in data generation capability.  In order for Mizzou to maintain a competitive research environment, we need to expand the computational resources available for bioinformatics analysis of large data which include sequence data.  It will require an initial investment of $619,000 in early 2016 to build the needed core infrastructure and will require ongoing funding to maintain and expand this infrastructure.  Initial investments (cost share of $231,000) made by Mizzou in 2005 to bring next-generation sequencing to this campus have been returned many-fold.  Based on a survey sent to MU researchers in November 2015, a total of 66 grants have been awarded involving sequencing for a total of $87.5M.  $7.6M of that is directly attributable to sequence data generation/analysis. In addition, another $7.9M in grant funding has been submitted and remains pending.  This research has led to 173 refereed journal articles in top-tier journals producing over 6,000 citations.  Additionally, 19 M.S., 62 Ph.D. and 21 postdocs have been trained as a result of these sequence related research projects.  Plant and animal researchers at MU have been at the forefront of the next-generation sequencing revolution.  However, based on the diversity of grants and papers gathered by the survey, sequence analysis provides a common foundation that ties together many disciplines on campus.  As such, investment in computational capacity directed at sequence data analysis will serve the entire campus and provide technological ties between disciplines.

Subsequent analyses based on the partial credit model explored the internal structure of eHEALS data.\r\nResults: Compared with 1- and 2-factor models, the 3-factor eHEALS structure showed the best global E-SEM model fit indices (root mean square error of approximation=.07; comparative fit index=1.0; Tucker-Lewis index=1.0). Nonetheless, the 3 factors were highly correlated (r range .36 to .65). Item analyses revealed that eHEALS items 2 through 5 were overfit to a minor degree (mean square infit/outfit values <1.0; t statistics less than \u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.0), but the internal structure of Likert scale response options functioned as expected. Overfitting eHEALS items (2-5) displayed a similar degree of information for respondents at similar points on the latent continuum. Test information curves suggested that eHEALS may capture more information about older adults at the higher end of the latent continuum (ie, those with high eHealth literacy) than at the lower end of the continuum (ie, those with low eHealth literacy). Item reliability (value=.92) and item separation (value=11.31) estimates indicated that eHEALS responses were reliable and stable.\r\nConclusions: Results support administering eHEALS over the telephone when surveying older adults regarding their use of the Internet for health information. eHEALS scores best captured 3 factors (or subscales) to measure eHealth literacy in older adults; however, statistically significant correlations between these 3 factors suggest an overarching unidimensional structure with 3 underlying dimensions. As older adults continue to use the Internet more frequently to find and evaluate health information, it will be important to consider modifying the original eHEALS to adequately measure societal shifts in online health information seeking among aging populations.Open Access Fundin", "datePublished": "2017-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.2196/jmir.8481", "publisher": "'JMIR Publications Inc.'", "subjects": ["Article"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/132289968.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132289968.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/132289968", "http://hdl.handle.net/10342/6440", "https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.8481"]}, {"authors": ["MA, Siqi"], "title": "Automatic vulnerability detection and repair", "datePublished": "2018-05-01T07:00:00", "subjects": ["Master Thesis"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/200255238.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/200255238.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/200255238", "https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/etd_coll/185", "https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1185&amp;context=etd_coll"]}, {"authors": ["Schols, Maurice"], "title": "Continuing technology professional development: A technology learning preferences instrument to support teacher educators\u2019 workplace learning", "datePublished": "2016-06-20T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/362222093.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/362222093.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/362222093", "https://pure.roehampton.ac.uk/portal/en/studentTheses/07a1731f-420f-42ed-af16-7956aeea8eda", "https://pure.roehampton.ac.uk/ws/files/420518/Maurice_Schols_Thesis.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Xing, F.", "Peng, G.", "Liang, T.", "Zuo, S.", "Li, S."], "title": "Managing changes initiated by industrial big data technologies : a technochange management model", "description": "With the adoption of Internet of Things and advanced data analytical technologies in manufacturing firms, the industrial sector has launched an evolutionary journey toward the 4th industrial revolution, or so called Industry 4.0.

The CAPs varied by primary funding source. Four to six participants per site were college juniors or seniors, recent college graduates, or individuals who enrolled in college but withdrew before graduating and never returned. \n      The data highlighted the following key themes and implications: (1) CAPs in this study were largely successful in helping alumni enroll in colleges and universities known to be selective; (2) While the CAPs exerted helpful influences, alumni nonetheless faced serious challenges through the college years, such as meeting academic demands and navigating barriers of bigotry and intolerance that are deeply embedded on many campuses; and (3) CAPs in this study influenced alumni\u2019s post-college aspirations, directions, and trajectories regarding career choices, and family and community uplift.

The study was based on a school construction project which was used as a case study at which the researcher\u2019s role is that of \u2018Project Manager\u2019. The project status before the study was that it was almost 100% behind schedule and experienced a wide variety of problems ranging from constant site shut-downs due to community protests, contract scope changes, poor quality workmanship and material related setbacks. The study, through literature review, considered some of the methods currently used in the built environment to mitigate unforeseen problems to construction projects and ascertained the extent to which these tools and techniques for risk management on construction projects were used. The idea behind this was to review, document and package the application of a project management strategy that would be suitably effective for resolving the problems faced on the project site. Design \u2013 The research design used in this study was the \u2018Case study design\u2019 and \u2018Experimental design\u2019 in which the \u2018Action-research\u2019 approach and \u2018Embedded survey within a case study\u2019 were employed on the construction project site, managed by the researcher in his capacity as Project Manager. This was done by organising role-players as participants in focus group workshops facilitated by the researcher where the participants interacted with the researcher and amongst themselves in an effort to identify and find possible problems affecting the project. The researcher introduced stimulating action to project management processes based on the information sourced from the literature review and data obtained from focus group workshops where the outcomes were observed, recorded, analysed and conclusions drawn. Results \u2013 The investigation results revealed that the applied management strategies in form of the approach adapted from the integrated use of value and risk management provided a conclusion that the approach was an effective and preferable technique to use in comparison with the commonly used contingencies and float for risk management on construction projects. The above processes also confirmed its relevance as an appropriate technique for risk management of most unforeseen problems which have an effect on the three constraints of time, cost and quality. A further analysis of literature reviewed, which was also supported by other studies previously undertaken, concluded that most professionals in the construction sector such as Quantity Surveyors, Construction Managers, Project Managers and Architects were aware of Value Management but rarely applied it on projects for risk management purposes. Practical Implications \u2013 Developing a standard model for the implementation of measures to deal or manage unplanned problems on a project is a challenge as most projects do not have a set model to deal with unforeseen project problems which compels the reliance on contingencies and float. However, any envisaged model must be supported by a quality control system which allows for easy implementation of interventions. The prototype step model conceptualised by the researcher is intended to enable project functionaries and project managers through its unique and easy steps to navigate through any problem which may be encountered on a project. This is regardless of the project phase in which such challenges manifest as there is no preferred model capable of resolving much more than one setback at any given time in comparison with the strategy recommended by this study, which may also be applicable to other sites where similar dynamics exist. Limitations \u2013 The study was conducted in a confined environment which required to be confirmed through longitudinal research which is broader and based on many different projects hence the results could not be generalised but only limited to the current project and further research was recommended. The single case study design was also a limitation as the results were not broad enough and were also subjective for generalisation to other project sites. Conclusion \u2013 This project management strategy in which the integrated value management approach was used has the potential of being employed as an intervention technique for unforeseen problems related to construction projects provided the processes derived from further research are documented and packaged into a process to be used as a standard model. The project management strategy has the potential to mitigate problems related to time, cost and quality only during the three phases of the project which are, initiation, planning, and implementation and excludes the closing phase to enhance project value. In iii essence, when the project cost and time are effectively managed and reduced, with enhanced quality, the result is an improved project with significant prospects of success", "datePublished": "2020-02-25T06:05:12", "publisher": "Department of Construction Economics and Management", "subjects": ["Master Thesis", "Masters", "MSc"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/288496355.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288496355.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/288496355", "http://hdl.handle.net/11427/31284"]}, {"authors": ["Lawrence, Mboweni"], "title": "Exploring teachers' morale in selected primary schools of Bohlabela District", "description": "The primary aim of this study was to explore primary school teachers\u2019 experiences that influence\r\ntheir morale in Bohlabela District, Mpumalanga Province in order to improve practice and create\r\na suitable environment for effective teaching and learning. The aim was achieved by exploring\r\nteachers\u2019 experiences, identifying factors which influence the morale of teachers and developing\r\nstrategies which could be applied to motivate teachers in their profession. The empirical inquiry\r\nwas informed by behaviourism as a theoretical framework as well as the extant literature on\r\nteachers\u2019 morale.

This paper explores current leadership gap data and the consequences of the disparity between men and women in leadership roles. Next, the paper describes how stereotypes can create the underlying problem: limiting internal beliefs. This paper proposes an evidence-based solution drawn from the field of positive psychology. A review of decades of research suggests that with increased career self-efficacy, women will be more likely to reach for, persist in, and succeed in senior leadership positions. The paper\u2019s appendices describe four practical interventions that can be implemented by women and organizations designed to raise women\u2019s career self-efficacy", "datePublished": "2018-01-01T08:00:00", "publisher": "ScholarlyCommons", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/214213369.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/214213369.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/214213369", "https://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstone/150", "https://repository.upenn.edu/mapp_capstoneabstracts/171"]}, {"authors": ["Karolina, Rahmi"], "title": "Modul guru pembelajar paket keahlian teknik konstruksi baja kelompok kompetensi I", "description": "Pedoman penyusunan modul diklat guru pembelajar bagi guru dan tenaga kependidikan merupakan petunjuk bagi penyelenggara pelatihan di dalam melaksakan pengembangan modul.

The objectives of study were to investigate to what extent the community is involved in dissemination of secondary education in public sector, to find out the benefits of community involvement in secondary education, to unpack the issues and challenges faced by teachers due to lack of community participation and to stumble on the character of education in socio-economic development of Baltistan region. Researcher used stratified sampling technique. There are six tehsils in district Skardus i.e. Skardu, Gamba Skardu, Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar and Rondu. To give representation to wide spread geographic region of the Skardu District, these Tehsils were divided into two groups. The group 1 was comprised of Skardu, Gamba Skardu and Roundu while the remaining three Tehsils (Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar) were put into group 2. Seventeen institutions were taken as sample of the study from six Tehsils of the Skardu District formed 44.7% of available 38 Public Sector Secondary Schools in Skardu. Two teachers and the head teacher were contacted for the purpose of data collection from each sample school. Opinion of 13 community notables was also sought through structured interview. The data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics, chi square and percentage methods. On the basis of findings it was concluded that majority teachers and head teachers of secondary schools viewed that the community participation is necessary part of education, majority of teachers, head teachers and community notables viewed that the main reasons of lack of community / parents participation are illiteracy, unawareness and busy life due to economic pressure, all respondents\u2019 teachers, head teachers and community notables have supported the statement that the parent\u2019s active participation can enhance the student\u2019s achievements, and all respondent have responded that Education plays a vital role in socio-economic development of the society. The recommendations of the study included that there is great need to make aware the parents about the importance of their participation in child\u2019s educational achievement, raise awareness about the relation between school and community, repeated contacts and meetings with the SMC members, conduct of seminars, workshops can play a vital role for the development of community participation in education, community members can invite in co-curricular activities like Parent\u2019s days, cleanliness weeks, and prize distribution ceremonies and national and Islamic events, there may be a counseling center in school where counseling of students may be conducted and parents and community members may also be invite, through community involvement it can be possible to make more and more registration of children in the school, and\u00a0 media both print and electronic is also an effective source through which community can be motivated to participate in education", "datePublished": "2018-10-16T00:00:00", "publisher": "European Online Journal of Natural and Social Sciences", "subjects": [], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/296307531.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/296307531.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/296307531", "http://european-science.com/eojnss/article/view/5375"]}, {"authors": ["Sahito, Zafarullah", "Khawaja, Mumtaz", "Siddiqui, Abida", "Shaheen, Anjum", "Saeed, Humera"], "title": "Role of Tuition Centers in the Performance and Achievement of Students: A Case of Hyderabad District, Sindh, Pakistan", "description": "This research is designed to explore the importance of tuition centers in the perception of students.

Unfortunately, countless students in school districts across the Nation daily receive unequal access to information in school, resulting from the inequitable distribution of resources caused by property tax based systems of funding public education.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court declared in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950), and Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), that every student is entitled to equal access to equal information undergirding the critical thinking training they receive in schools. However, the Supreme Court sanctioned school funding disparities  caused by property tax based systems by claiming that there is no fundamental right to an education in the United States per the Court\u2019s ruling in San Antonio v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973). As a result, this paper asserts that the funding disparities resulting from property tax based school funding systems is the chief cause of disparate access to information in schools based purely on where students live. Disparate access to information in schools in turn leads to disparities in critical thinking training since the depth and degree of critical thinking training depends on one\u2019s access to information in school.

This study set in Indonesia sought to explore the washback influence of the national examination system on the attitudes, behaviours and motivations of teachers, learners and parents (Pearson, 1998). Previous studies on national examination in Indonesia had explored the concept without paying sufficient attention to the context and culture within which washback takes place; a culture where examination corruption remains professionally unacknowledged but all too often remains part of practice.\n\nUsing an interpretivist paradigm this study explored the perceptions of the experiences of teachers, learners and parents involved in the national examination system and identified its washback effect. In particular it explored ways in which the national examination affected teaching and learning practices in final year classrooms that in Indonesia are dominated by the national examination cycle. Finally, the study investigated how students\u2018 experiences in the national examination year might be improved.\n\nThe evidence emerging from the thematic analysis of interviews with eight English teachers, ten parents and focus group discussions with 29 final year students attending junior secondary schools identified three main washback themes. The national examination had influenced participants\u2018 feelings, their perceptions and their practices. All participating groups had participants who reported a wide range of feelings about their experiences of national examination, from neutral feelings to high levels of anxiety. The analysis also indicated that participants in each group had recognised both the positive and negative washback effects of national examination. The use of the examination for selection purposes was perceived to motivate students to learn. However, the findings also suggested that the national examination was considered by members of each group to assess students in ways that were regarded as unfair. All three groups showed how the examination influenced their role and practices as teachers, students and parents. However, although members of both parental and pupil communities made reference to a number of corrupt practices, no teacher acknowledged such practice focusing only on the more conventional washback effects of curriculum narrowing and rehearsal pedagogy.\n\nThe evidence from this study was used to extend a model of the relationship between learning and assessment theory proposed by Baird, et.al. (2017). Only when there is an adequate consideration of the culture within which these theories emerge can there be potential for these theories to have traction in offering a lens through which to interrogate practice. Finding ways to engage with features of Indonesian school culture including anxiety, religion, family expectations, corruption, gender inequality and collectivism is a central part of understanding the nature of national examination washback. Without a deeper understanding and acceptance of the problem, Indonesia, and other countries in similar circumstances, is likely to remain in a cycle of constant innovation with little meaningful, constructive change in the assessment process", "datePublished": "2020-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/324197584.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/324197584.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/324197584", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/81300/", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/81300/1/2020PuspitasariPhD.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Lord, Montague", "Chang, Susan"], "title": "Pre-Feasibility Study of Sarawak-West Kalimantan Cross-Border Value Chains", "description": "This pre-feasibility study on Sarawak-West Kalimantan cross-border value chains covers six topics: \n\n \tIt analyzes existing trade patterns and competitive advantages of Sarawak and West Kalimantan, as well as government objectives in promoting cross-border commercial activities. \n\n \tIt proposes a border economic area spread over a wide geographic area that covers a network of interrelated activities and provides a fully integrated approach to the border economic area design and implementation. \n\n \tIt identifies potential cross-border value chains that can serve as high-profile projects for the border economic area. \n\n \tIt determines the preference orderings of project features by key stakeholders such as government and development partners, commercial entities, and the local population. \n\n \tIt estimates the net monetary returns for the project portfolio, a cost-effectiveness analysis of the stand-alone capacity-building projects, ranks stakeholders\u2019 non-monetary preferences, and incorporates the the preference ranking order into the project portfolio\u2019s net monetary returns. \n\n \tIt provides an overall program appraisal for the set of projects.\n\n \tBased on pre-feasibility results, it lays out a plan for implementation of the border area development program", "datePublished": "2019-02-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["MPRA Paper", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/223056300.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/223056300.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/223056300", "https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/94732/1/MPRA_paper_94732.pdf", "https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/94732/"]}, {"authors": ["Dailey, Kimberli"], "title": "A Hermeneutic Phenomenological Exploration of the Impact of Technology on the Collaborative Practices of Rural Middle School Teachers", "description": "This qualitative study described the impact of collaboration and technology-based communication on the professional experiences of rural middle school classroom teachers.

The importance of this element within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise the relevance of using indicators, they do not specify any methodology to identify which indicators have to be implemented. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already implemented performance indicators, most of them do not mention the method applied to obtain the indicators. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports to identify indicators may not necessarily be science-based or systematic in approach. For these reasons, the need to develop a new methodology able to identify the ports' most adequate indicators was detected. Therefore, a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP) was developed. It aims at identifying performance indicators in ports and providing guidelines for their proper implementation. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat/teip) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly and practical as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user. This new methodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. TEIP aims at helping port managers at easily determining their significant port indicators, which provides valuable elements for the decision-making processes.Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft", "datePublished": "2017-05-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.02.017", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["Article"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81582985.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/81582985", "http://hdl.handle.net/2117/103545"]}, {"authors": ["Akombelwa, Doris Mulenga Malema."], "title": "Children\u2019s right to education: a case of school fee policies in South Africa.", "description": "Masters Degree.

It is argued that decentralization of educational governance that would allow more autonomy and increased decision-making authority at the school level, which would ultimately result in improved educational quality. Private language schools in Egypt should have a degree of autonomy to make decisions that would enable them to provide a higher quality education, within a regulatory framework that supports rather than hinders their progress. In reality, these schools are constrained by the central control of curricula, assessment, teachers, budgets, and decision-making, which are ultimately all the influential aspects that define the status of educational quality. The potential that private national schools have in terms of providing quality education, along with the prevalence of decentralization initiatives and the limited research done on private language schools in Egypt has sparked questions about how these schools operate under such a centralized context and how this context affects the quality of education provided there. Other questions were also raised to explore how much autonomy do stakeholders truly have, and whether or not there is a discrepancy between the policy discourse and the implementation of decentralization initiatives. The perceptions of 38 stakeholders from school principals, teachers, parents and officials from the Ministry of Education are demonstrated in this paper in an attempt to address the above questions. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews was collected from four private language schools in Egypt. Results show that stakeholders appear frustrated with the lack of autonomy granted to them and view this matter as a hindrance to educational quality. Drawbacks associated with centralization such as bureaucracy, ineffective decision-making, and lack of accountability on teachers continue to manifest in private language schools, Stakeholders have indicated that the schools have the potential to assume further responsibility, autonomy and accountability, yet most influential decision-making still takes place at the highest central levels at the MOE. Further along, data analysis shows that there may be multiple impediments to the true implementation of decentralization. The fact remains that educational decentralization continues to be a debatable subject that is challenging to conceptualize, and further research is required to establish its effects, or lack thereof, on educational quality.    \u00e2\u20ac", "datePublished": "2017-02-01T08:00:00", "publisher": "AUC Knowledge Fountain", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/333723457.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/333723457.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/333723457", "https://fount.aucegypt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1321&amp;context=etds", "https://fount.aucegypt.edu/etds/322"]}, {"authors": ["Bocazar, Beatrix"], "title": "Discourses of Creativity in Ontario Kindergarten Curriculum", "description": "The concept of creativity is ubiquitous in educational reports, policies, and curricula in the minority world.

This study is anchored in a Critical Discourse Analysis theoretical framework and represents an inquiry of creativity in kindergarten curricula. The aims of this inquiry were to identify creativity common sense beliefs and theories and to examine which ones have been employed in which curricula, and with what implications for children, teachers, educators, and society. I designed a qualitative case study (Stake, 2005) consisting of participant observations, field notes, and interviews from one Ontario kindergarten class for one cycle of activity in the fall of 2012, which demonstrated the operational curriculum. I also conducted a critical discourse analysis (CDA) (Weiss & Wodak, 2003) of texts used in the kindergarten classroom, or required to be used, by teachers, early childhood educators (ECEs), and principals or coordinators of programs. These texts included the draft version of the programmatic kindergarten curriculum (Ontario Ministry of Education [OME], 2010) and the final version (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2016). Further, as a counterpoint, I analysed texts from Reggio Emilia\u2019s early childhood education curriculum, as identified by teachers, to contrast and illustrate ethical pedagogical possibilities. The findings resulted from the ethical comparison of the studied educational paradigms were categorized in terms of enablers and constrainers of creativity. The emergent paradigm of creativity specific to Reggio Emilia, which draws on multiple theories while using ethics as gatekeeper, is the most beneficent for children and the system. The constraints of creativity as illustrated by the analysis of the Ontario programmatic and operational curriculum are sourced in the neoliberal discourse in education, in the accountability for efficiency\u2019s sake, in creativity promoted and standardized in areas of learning, which will be of use in the future working age of the child, in transforming teachers and ECEs as managers, accountants, and grade one pre-trainers, and students in objects of political will and desire", "datePublished": "2018-07-05T21:15:00", "publisher": "Scholarship@Western", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/215385279.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/215385279.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/215385279", "https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/5494", "https://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7490&amp;context=etd"]}, {"authors": ["Letshwene, Mantekana Jacobine"], "title": "Key generic curriculum factors affecting grade twelve learner performance : a multiple case study of South African secondary schools", "description": "Improving Grade 12 learner performance is a critical issue because only a few learners are able to go to university. Grade 8 learners lack the required subject content knowledge to be in secondary school. The aim of this study was to identify key generic curriculum factors affecting Grade 12 learner performance. The aim was addressed by conducting the relevant literature study and an empirical investigation.\r\nIn various studies, the implementation of the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) has been associated with tremendous challenges, including content congestion, workload, too much paperwork, too much assessment and limited time. There are ongoing expressions of uncertainty about the type of learners the CAPS is producing. Many of these learners do not understand English, cannot read or write, do not care about their education, are not doing their homework and are ill-disciplined. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, this study offers a critical reflection of key curriculum factors affecting learners\u2019 performance.\r\nThis multiple case study was undertaken using semi-structured individual interviews with 12 Heads of Departments, which were conducted to explore their perceptions and experiences regarding the CAPS. Six focus group interviews with teachers were also conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of their views.\r\nThe findings of the study offer a deeper understanding of the key generic curriculum factors affecting learner performance which require a special intervention at foundation phase to ensure that primary school learners are prepared for Grade 12. It is envisaged that the research findings will assist the Department of Basic Education with decisions relating to improving learners\u2019 performance.\r\nThe study recommends that involving as many experienced teachers as possible in the curriculum design will have a positive impact on learner performance. It is recommended that the Department of Basic Education should reduce the number of subjects at secondary school level; align time allocated to complete the syllabus with the Annual Teaching Plan; replace School-Based Assessments with tests; conduct an exit examination at the end of every phase; identify one prescribed textbook for each subject; encourage top performing students to become teachers; and make teaching a high-status profession. Experienced teachers should be given an opportunity to design the curriculum because they understand the challenges facing the education system. The Department of Basic Education should minimise changes to the curriculum because the teachers work better with what they know.\r\niv\r\nThe study concluded that the first 30 minutes of each day should be an English period to enhance reading skills; learners should be given an opportunity to choose subjects from Grade 8 not from Grade 10; the pass rate should be raised to 50% for all the subjects; Life Orientation should be done only up to Grade 7; more Further Education and Training colleges should be opened so that learners can be directed accordingly if they cannot cope in a mainstream school; progression and adjustment of marks should be stopped; more teacher training colleges should be opened; more and better resources at all under-resourced schools must be provided; each school should have a full-time psychologist on staff; and learners should be motivated regularly by educated or successful community members.Dit is noodsaaklik om die prestasie van Graad 12-leerlinge te verbeter aangesien weinig van hulle aan \u0149 universiteit verder kan studeer. Graad 8-leerders beskik nie oor die vakkennis wat op ho\u00ebrskool van hulle verwag word nie. Die oogmerk van hierdie studie was om vas te stel watter betekenisvolle generiese kurrikulumfaktore die prestasie van Graad 12-leerders bepaal. \u0149 Literatuurstudie en empiriese ondersoek is met die oog hierop gedoen.\r\nVolgens verskeie studies bring die implementering van die Kurrikulum- en Assesseringsbeleidsverklaring (KABV) geweldige uitdagings mee waaronder die vertering van lesinhoud, \u0149 groot werklas, te veel papierwerk, te veel assessering en te min tyd. Bedenkinge word gereeld uitgespreek oor die soort leerder wat die KABV tot gevolg het. Talle leerders verstaan nie Engels nie, kan nie lees of skryf nie, is nie oor hulle eie opvoeding besorg nie, doen nie hulle huiswerk nie, en is ongehoorsaam. Hierdie studie besin krities oor die betekenisvolle kurrikulumfaktore wat leerders se prestasie be\u00efnvloed.\r\nIn hierdie meervoudige gevallestudie is halfgestruktureerde onderhoude met 12 departementshoofde gevoer. Hulle perspepsie en ervaring van die KABV is in die onderhoude verken. Ses fokusgroeponderhoude is met onderwysers gevoer om hulle siening daarvan te verkry.\r\nDie bevindings van die studie bied \u0149 grondige insig in die betekenisvolle generiese kurrikulumfaktore wat leerderprestasie be\u00efnvloed. Dit vereis ingryping in die grondslagfase om laerskoolleerders vir ho\u00ebrskool en uiteindelik Graad 12 gereed te kry. Op grond van hierdie bevindings kan die Departement van Basiese Onderwys veranderings aanbring wat die prestasie van leerders kan verbeter.\r\nDie studie beveel aan dat soveel ervare onderwysers as moontlik by die kurrikulumontwerp betrek word. Dit sal leerdersprestasie verbeter. Daar word voorts aanbeveel dat die Departement van Basiese Onderwys die aantal ho\u00ebrskoolvakke verminder; die tydperk waarin die sillabus afgehandel word, met die jaarlikse onderrigplan in ooreenstemming bring;\r\nvii\r\nskoolassessering met toetse vervang; leerders aan die einde van elke fase \u0149 uitgangseksamen laat skryf; een handboek vir elke vak voorskryf; skrander studente aanmoedig om onderwysers te word; en die aansien van die onderwysberoep verhoog. Ervare onderwysers moet aan die opstel van die kurrikulum meewerk omdat hulle die struikelblokke in die onderwysstelsel die beste begryp.

Leerders moet reeds in Graad 8 vakke kan kies, nie eers in Graad 10 nie. Die slaagpunt moet in alle vakke 50% wees. Lewensori\u00ebntering moet slegs tot Graad 7 aangebied word. Leerders wat nie in \u0149 hoofstroomskool die mas opkom nie, moet aan kolleges vir verdere onderwys en opleiding verder kan leer. Punte moenie opgeskuif word nie. Meer onderwyseropleidingskolleges moet geopen word. Skole met beperkte hulpbronne moet van meer en beter hulpmiddels voorsien word. \u0149 Voltydse sielkundige moet by elke skool aangestel word, en suksesvolle en opgevoede gemeenskapslede moet leerders gereeld motiveer.Kaonafat\u0161o ya ma\u0161omelo a Kreite ya 12 ke ntlha ya bohlokwa ka ge baithuti ba mmalwa ba kgona go ya yunibesithi.

The purpose of this causal comparative study was to examine the effects of two distinct pre-kindergarten phonics programs, a linguistic phonics program and a basal phonics program, on short and long-term literacy outcomes. The overarching question addressed in this study was whether the type of literacy instruction in pre-kindergarten predicts outcomes in kindergarten and grade 3 and to what extent, if any, these relationships are moderated by demographic variables. More specifically, this study was undertaken to determine whether the type of literacy instruction in pre-kindergarten; a linguistic phonics reading program, Magic Penny (MP), and a basal phonics reading program, Houghton Mifflin (HM), impacts short and/or long-term literacy outcomes as measured by the DIBELS assessment in grade K and grade 3 and the New York State Test of Performance (NYSTP) in grade 3, and to what extent the effects (if any) are attributable to or modified by the demographic variables of gender, economic status, ELL, and race/ethnicity. A total of 594 students from approximately 30 Title 1 designated schools from a large school district in New York State were included in the study. The intervention group consisted of 297 students that received MP instruction in Pre-kindergarten in any of the years from 2009-10 through 2014-15; the control group consisted of 297 randomly selected pre-kindergarten students who received instruction in the HM Pre-Kindergarten literacy program. Binomial logistical regression was executed with extant data from the 594 pre-kindergarten students in order to predict short and long-term literacy outcomes. In this study the type of literacy instruction (MP vs. HM) in pre-kindergarten did not predict proficiency in DIBELS grade K (short-term effect) or grade 3 NYSTP (long-term effect), nor was there demonstrable improvement in the ability to predict if a student was proficient given the student characteristics. A significant difference in reading performance in grade three (long-term effect) between the two programs as measured by the grade 3 DIBELS assessment was demonstrated: Students who received the MP intervention were almost two times more likely to score proficient on the grade 3 DIBELS assessment than students instructed with HM in pre-kindergarten. Ethnicity was negatively correlated with performance for each ethnicity suggesting there are unmeasured factors other than race/ethnicity that overcome a negative effect of race on student\u2019s performance on these assessments that are mitigated by the use of an instructional (linguistic) phonics program such as MP. Though no significant differences between the two reading programs were demonstrable in the foundational skills assessment DIBELS in kindergarten or in the NYSTP grade 3 summative assessment, the results of the foundational skills measured in grade 3 DIBELS are substantial enough to demonstrate the value of a linguistic phonics program such as Magic Penny. Magic Penny instruction in pre-kindergarten resulted in increased literacy achievement in grade 3 foundational literacy skills as well as mitigated the factors attributed to race", "datePublished": "2020-05-06T07:00:00", "publisher": "eRepository @ Seton Hall", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/322982162.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/322982162.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/322982162", "https://scholarship.shu.edu/dissertations/2771", "https://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3871&amp;context=dissertations"]}, {"authors": ["Daniel, John"], "title": "A Transcendental Phenomenological Study Describing the Perceptions of Barbadian Teachers on Secondary School Violence", "description": "The purpose of this transcendental phenomenological study was to describe and give meaning to teachers\u2019 perceptions of secondary school (U.S. sixth through 12th grade) violence in Barbados, West Indies through their lived experiences.  In this study school violence was defined as (a) individual victimization experiences (Furlong, Chung, Bates & Morrison, 1995), (b) gang activities and weapon possession (Kingerly, Puritt, & Heuberger, 1985), (c) illegal substance abuse (Furlong, Casas, Corral, Chung, & Bates, 1997), (d) bullying (Morrison, 2009), and (e) conflict and crisis management (Nickerson & Brock, 2011, Gorton & Alston, 2009).  The central research question was: How do first through fifth year (U.S. sixth through 12th grade) teachers in four different government-owned schools in Barbados describe their experiences with school violence, school climate, and school safety?  The theory guiding this study was Urie Bronfenbrenner\u2019s (1977) ecological systems theory as it explained the multilayered and multifaceted phenomenon of school violence.  A total of 16 participants were selected using the criterion sampling (Creswell, 2013).  Documentation, individual interviews, and focus groups were used as data collection tools (Patton, 1990).  A combination of Moustakas (1994) and Saldana (2013) data analysis methods were employed in this research study.  A total of ten sub-themes were identified in this study.  Five sub-themes that describe how teacher participants in four different government-owned schools in Barbados described school climate and school safety; three sub-themes described what ecological factors teacher participants perceived needed to be developed, to help improve the school climate and create safer school environments, and two sub-themes revealed what ecological factors were developed, to help reduce school with a view of improving school safety", "datePublished": "2017-09-01T07:00:00", "publisher": "Scholars Crossing", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/129593850.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/129593850.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/129593850", "https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/doctoral/1521", "https://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2577&amp;context=doctoral"]}, {"authors": ["DiRuzza, Emily M", "Grabinsky, Jessica", "Pelissari, Katherine", "Consedine, Timothy Edward"], "title": "Renewable Energy SMART Lessons: An Educational Approach to a Sustainable Future in Namibia", "description": "This project assisted EduVentures Trust in developing four renewable energy SMART modules to expand sustainability awareness throughout Namibia.

The importance of this element within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise the relevance of using indicators, they do not specify any methodology to identify which indicators have to be implemented. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already implemented performance indicators, most of them do not mention the method applied to obtain the indicators. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports to identify indicators may not necessarily be science-based or systematic in approach. For these reasons, the need to develop a new methodology able to identify the ports' most adequate indicators was detected. Therefore, a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP) was developed. It aims at identifying performance indicators in ports and providing guidelines for their proper implementation. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat/teip) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly and practical as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user. This new methodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. TEIP aims at helping port managers at easily determining their significant port indicators, which provides valuable elements for the decision-making processes.Peer Reviewe", "datePublished": "2017-05-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2017.02.017", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/submittedVersion", "info:eu-repo/semantics/article"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/301253142", "http://hdl.handle.net/2117/103545"]}, {"authors": ["Baldassa, Alessandro"], "title": "Diffusione, variabili ed effetti economici delle recensioni online nel settore degli alloggi turistici", "datePublished": "2019-07-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Laurea triennale", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/224298388.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/224298388.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/224298388", "http://tesi.cab.unipd.it/62827/1/Baldassa_Alessandro.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Mojapelo, Samuel Maredi"], "title": "Challenges faced by libraries in a democratic South Africa: A case of three community libraries in Limpopo Province", "description": "Community libraries are crucial for people to have access to information to satisfy their multiple needs.

Researcher used stratified sampling technique. There are six tehsils in district Skardus i.e. Skardu, Gamba Skardu, Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar and Rondu. To give representation to wide spread geographic region of the Skardu District, these Tehsils were divided into two groups. The group 1 was comprised of Skardu, Gamba Skardu and Roundu while the remaining three Tehsils (Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar) were put into group 2. Seventeen institutions were taken as sample of the study from six Tehsils of the Skardu District formed 44.7% of available 38 Public Sector Secondary Schools in Skardu. Two teachers and the head teacher were contacted for the purpose of data collection from each sample school. Opinion of 13 community notables was also sought through structured interview. The data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics, chi square and percentage methods. On the basis of findings it was concluded that majority teachers and head teachers of secondary schools viewed that the community participation is necessary part of education, majority of teachers, head teachers and community notables viewed that the main reasons of lack of community / parents participation are illiteracy, unawareness and busy life due to economic pressure, all respondents\u2019 teachers, head teachers and community notables have supported the statement that the parent\u2019s active participation can enhance the student\u2019s achievements, and all respondent have responded that Education plays a vital role in socio-economic development of the society.

To address this issue, we propose a hybrid\narchitecture based on a novel hierarchical multi-granularity attention\nmechanism, named Multi-granularity Attention-based Hybrid Neural Network\n(MahNN). The attention mechanism is to assign different weights to different\nparts of the input sequence to increase the computation efficiency and\nperformance of neural models. In MahNN, two types of attentions are introduced:\nthe syntactical attention and the semantical attention. The syntactical\nattention computes the importance of the syntactic elements (such as words or\nsentence) at the lower symbolic level and the semantical attention is used to\ncompute the importance of the embedded space dimension corresponding to the\nupper latent semantics.

Although the underlying curriculum is no different, the IEB exam is thought to be more challenging and to encourage more critical thinking and deeper engagement with the material than the DBE exam. Thus, this research paper aims to provide a rigorous investigation of whether those students who write the IEB exam at the end of their matric year achieve higher university grades in their first year of study, as well as a decomposition of this effect into a teaching effect and a testing effect. This is done by exploiting within-school variation of examination boards. Given that studies investigating independent school impacts on university performance have predominantly been conducted internationally (McNabb et al., 2002; Ogg et al., 2009; Smith &amp; Naylor, 2001; Smith &amp; Naylor, 2005), this paper will add to the literature in the South African context. By using the techniques of OLS, quantile regression, binary choice probit models and ordered probit models, this paper attempts to provide a holistic view of the effect that the IEB school-leaving examination has on a student\u2019s academic performance at a tertiary level. The data used in this study is also unique, in that it is made up of an amalgamation of student record data obtained from the University of Cape Town (UCT), as well as governmental survey data. This paper finds that the IEB examination has a strong positive effect of between 1.6 and 6.5 percentage points on first-year GPA at UCT, particularly in the Medicine and Engineering faculties. Furthermore, this effect is present, but decreasing across the entirety of the performance distribution. Students with an IEB matric are significantly more likely to achieve a 2nd class pass or higher at the end of their first year of study than are comparable students from Former African schools. When decomposing the IEB effect into a teaching effect and a testing effect, it was found that the majority of the impact of the IEB comes simply from the different exam, and that teaching effects are minimal. A further finding of interest is that the IEB effect seems to be independent of resource availability, and that simply the exposure to the alternative testing method is sufficient for students to see significant improvements in their university performance. These results are robust to changes in functional form, and provide a strong and clear picture that perhaps South Africa should be adopting more of the IEB policies towards teaching and learning on a national scale", "datePublished": "2020-02-27T12:05:35", "publisher": "'Business Department, School of Economics, Business & Accounting USP'", "subjects": ["Master Thesis", "Masters", "MCom"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/288496533.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288496533.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/288496533", "http://hdl.handle.net/11427/31374"]}, {"authors": ["Ira, Estyani Noviarningsih", "Dr. H., Giyoto, M.

The students got some problem\n\nin the teaching learningprocess especially in teaching vocabulary.\n\nThis is an Experimental Research. The research was carried out at SMP\n\nNegeri 03 Mojogedang from May until June 2017. The method used in this\n\nresearch was quasi experiment (pre-test and post-test design with non-equivalent\n\ncontrol group design).

This in-depth qualitative case study was conducted in a girls\u2019 government model school. This study focuses on curriculum and school practices of the secondary school section. Data was collected through interviews with staff, a participatory workshop with teachers, focus groups with students, classroom observation, and informal discussions. I also analyzed the Pakistan Studies textbook used in the secondary section of the school.\n\n\n\nUsing theories of critical education, intersectionality, and Galtung\u2019s violence triangle, I argue that despite recent political and curricular reform attempts, education in Pakistan reproduces a homogeneous concept of a legitimate citizen (male Sunni Muslim). While this evolved to unite an ethnically diverse Pakistan, it has contributed to identity-based violence (direct, structural, and cultural) against those that do not fit within this conception.\n\n\n\nIn this school, the Pakistan Studies textbooks create an official discourse that promotes this gendered and exclusionary citizenship. I show how the Pakistan studies textbook uses history and constitutional lessons to promote citizenship that is based in a masculine Islam meant to oppose the Hindu \u2018other\u2019 as well as to promote the exclusion of women and minorities from full citizenship. I also found that teachers own understandings of citizenship, which closely reflect the text, are deeply rooted in their understanding of their notions of the ideal Muslim woman. I find that the school rewards gendered behavior in both students and teachers. I then explore the extent to which the school reproduces other social divisions including religious, ethnicity, and class. I find that the school simultaneously reproduces, mitigates, and exacerbates these tensions. I then argue that the teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 understandings of the role of women to counter violence is rooted in the notions of middle class women\u2019s roles as mothers and supporters of men that are reproduced through school practice.\n\n\n\nThis study furthers the knowledge on the links between education and violence by showing that promoting a homogeneous ideal of a citizen through education, while intended as a nation building project, can contribute to structural, cultural and direct violence against women and minorities, limiting their agency to engage in social transformation", "datePublished": "2017-06-06T00:00:00", "subjects": ["LC1401", "LG060"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/82968175.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82968175.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/82968175", "http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/68415/1/Emerson%2C%20Ann.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Tabrizi Zarringhabaei, Ali Akbar", "Garibaldi, Luigi", "Marchesiello, Stefano", "Fasana, Alessandro"], "title": "Fault diagnosis of roller bearings using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and support vector machine (SVM)", "description": "Rolling bearings are widely used in rotating machinery and their fault is one of the most common causes of industrial machinery failure.

The evolution and the steps that these systems are passed through are explained. A collaborative system is implemented based on remote method invocation. Remote method invocation is one of the technologies of distributed systems. The old collaborative systems are examined and some deficiencies of these systems are observed. Based on these observations, a new system without these deficiencies is implemented. With the new collaborative system, many users communicate text based and visually.Y\u00fcksek LisansM.Sc", "datePublished": "2015-04-07T13:59:43", "publisher": "'Nara Institute of Science and Technology'", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Tez"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/62729467.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/62729467.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/62729467", "http://hdl.handle.net/11527/436"]}, {"authors": ["Office of Marketing and Communications"], "title": "GSU View, 2015-04-06", "description": "Newsletter published by Governors State University 2007-current", "datePublished": "2015-04-06T07:00:00", "publisher": "OPUS Open Portal to University Scholarship", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/214286139.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/214286139.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/214286139", "https://opus.govst.edu/gsuview/750", "https://opus.govst.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1749&amp;context=gsuview"]}, {"authors": ["Nemani\u010d, Jurij"], "title": "The comparison of web-based GIS applications used by municipal administrations", "description": "Space is a property that has to be managed, planned and in which the activities have to be distributed to ensure the highest quality of living.

This study investigated and described parental involvement through the School Board in school governance in a secondary school in Otjozondjupa region, Namibia. The study was conducted within a qualitative, interpretive paradigm. The study employed three data collection tools namely, semi-structured interviews, document analysis and observation. The School Board was made up of parents of different classes and backgrounds, i.e. employed, unemployed, professionals and business persons and with different levels of educational background. These members create a network that represents the voices of parents from different social groups, with different levels of social capital. The different levels of social capital shape the nature of the contributions and interactions on the Board. The study found that in spite of the frequency of interaction between the School Board, parents and the community the School Board is still in a dilemma as it is unable to connect with its prominent source of potential support, such as the business community, due to an outdated view that the school is well-off based on its historic status of privilege. With respect to communications with parents the focus tends to be on the negatives of learners\u2019 behaviour or performance and the task of the parents in this regard. Broadening the agenda of the collaboration to include positive aspects of the child would add to the motivation of parents and open possibilities for new forms of collaboration. The school lacks a well-coordinated system for utilizing the available resources as well as community expertise for the benefit of the school. On the strength of the findings, one of the recommendations is for a more structured program and strategy for the Boards various interactions with the community and parents", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Faculty of Education, Education", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Masters", "MEd"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/145046300.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/145046300.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/145046300", "http://hdl.handle.net/10962/d1017358", "http://vital.seals.ac.za:8080/vital/access/manager/Repository/vital:2047"]}, {"authors": ["Zulkepli, Noraini"], "title": "An Investigation into English as a Second Language (ESL) Learner Participation in Language Learning Opportunities:  A Social View", "description": "Learner participation in language learning opportunities has been configured differently by different learning theories. In the domain of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), the cognitive view of learning has been dominant in explaining learner participation. It has been widely accepted that it should be in the form of participation in oral activities which leads to gains in linguistic competence. The aim of this thesis is to understand the issue of learner participation from the social perspective, where a broader understanding of learning will be employed informed by the work of Lave and Wenger (1991) and others. To do so, this study investigates the forms of participation of six ESL learners in suburban Malaysia in two contexts: in-class and out-of-class. \n\nIn order to understand the issue of learner participation from a social view point, data were collected using classroom observations, learners\u2019 interviews, learner diaries, and photographs taken by them. All the data were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. In order to handle the large amount of data, the Nvivo software package was used for organisation and retrieval purposes.\n\nThe findings reveal several insights about learner participation. First, learners are active agents where they constantly make decisions on what to engage with and how, and act on the norms and expectations that are imposed on them in a particular sociocultural context. Second, the six learners are members of or aspired to become members of several communities: academically successful learners; successful ESL learners; proficient speakers of the target language; the classroom; and youth. Thus, they aligned their forms of participation with these various communities. Third, learners in this study tended to distinguish between learning and other kinds of engagement. They tended to equate certain forms of participation as actions that one needed to take to learn the language; thus other forms of participation accorded less value. \n\nIn this study, some insights from Communities of Practice (CoP) theory- learning as a process of gaining membership in a particular community and that learners move from peripheral to core membership- were used to understand the issue of learner participation. However, upon understanding and interpreting the data, it was found that CoP theory is limited in several ways. First, CoP focuses only on one type of community (e.g. the classroom) in one temporal dimension. Yet, findings indicate that there are several other communities that exist in the classroom at one time. Due to this shortcoming, this study has turned to the concept of \u2018figured worlds\u2019 (Holland et al, 2001). Secondly, CoP theory argues for a group dynamic. Less recognition is given to the fact that individual learners are also dynamic and agentive. Akkerman and Meijer (2011) suggest dialogical views on identity; in which a framework is provided that acknowledges the multiple, discontinuous and social nature of identity (a postmodern view), while at the same time assumes identity as being unitary, continuous and individual (a modern view). Thirdly, CoP tends to focus on a singular \u201cidentity-in-practice (Tan and Barton (2008). Tan and Barton (ibid: 50) argue for the plurality of identities-in-practice (IdPs); rather than a singular \u201cidentity-in-practice (IdP) as suggested by Lave and Wenger (1991).\n\nThe view of learning as boundary crossing seems to better describe the kinds of participation and learning that have been suggested by the findings generated in the study. Instead of looking at learning as participation in a particular community, learning as boundary crossing better captures the dynamic of learner participation in language learning opportunities, of learners as whole persons (rather than fragmented identities), and of learners as agentive beings.Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysi", "datePublished": "2014-02-20T04:00:06", "publisher": "College of Social Sciences and International Studies", "subjects": ["Thesis or dissertation", "Doctor of Philosophy in Education", "Doctoral", "PhD"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/12826612.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12826612.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/12826612", "http://hdl.handle.net/10036/3705"]}, {"authors": ["Kumala, Safitri Diah Nita"], "title": "IMPROVING STUDENTS\u2019 SPEAKING SKILL USING CONVERSATIONAL VIDEOS IN CLASS VIII E AT SMP NEGERI 2 KALASAN IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR OF 2011/2012", "description": "The objective of this research is to improve the speaking skill of Class VIII E students at SMP Negeri 2 Kalasan in the academic year of 2011/2012.

The steps of this research were reconnaissance, planning, conducting action and observation, and reflection. The participants of the research were the researcher, the English teacher, and the students of Class VIII E of SMP Negeri 2 Kalasan. There were two forms of the data in this study, namely qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data were obtained through conducting observation, in depth-interview with the students and the English teacher, making field notes, taking photographs to the teaching and learning process, and holding the discussion with the English teacher as a collaborator. Meanwhile, the quantitative data were obtained from the scoring of the students\u2019 performance in each cycle. In addition, the validity of the data was obtained through democratic validity, outcome validity, catalitic validity, dialog validity and process validity. Then, the reliability of the data was obtained by giving the genuine data, such as field notes, interview transcripts, photographs and observation checklist.\n\nThe results of the research showed that there were some improvements in students\u2019 speaking skill including pronunciation, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension. The improvements could be seen from the students\u2019 speaking performance during the implementation. The improvements were also supported by the progress of the average scores in Cycle 1 scoring and Cycle 2 scoring. Then, there were some students\u2019 positive behaviours toward the implementation of the conversational videos related to their participation in the class. They were more active than before in every activity, they actively participated in doing group discussion and role play. Also, the students were motivated to speak and to actively take part on the conversation. Conversational videos grabbed the students\u2019attention by providing the language used that could be seen and heard at once, so that their motivation was improved.

The certified thesis is available in the Institute Archives and Special Collections.Cataloged from student-submitted PDF version of thesis.Includes bibliographical references (p. 168-173).This thesis is an exploration of learning environments in the West Bank of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) as administered by private, refugee and public school systems. In considering the insularity of learning environments in the OPT, this thesis finds that despite increased school construction since 1994, public and refugee student drop-out rates have increased, enrollment rates have decreased, academic achievement is low, and students suffer from stress. It is hypothesized that if schools are conceptualized as part of a broader learning environment, then the socio-spatial issues impacting student success may be improved. To test this hypothesis, learning environments in the OPT are examined with a two-fold methodology: historical and architectural. The two-fold analysis utilizes a conceptual framework, where child, building, neighborhood context, and education system, are understood as the four components of a learning environment. The historical analysis is framed from the Late-Ottoman era until today and follows changing theories of education in parallel with the changing relationship between schools and the socio-spatial reality of the conflict. Results from the historical analysis indicate that educational institutions often cannot operate during times of crisis, leading local family and teacher networks to develop informal education systems in unconventional spaces. It is determined that learning environments must be able to adapt to the conflict and must embrace local communities as architectural, spatial, and social resources. This finding serves as a critical foundation for the architectural analysis. The architectural analysis uses data collected from field work at 24 schools in the West Bank in August of 2012 through informal interviews with locals, photography, and journaling. The data reveal that the socio-spatial contexts of each school are unique due in part to divisions of the land. In order to limit the number of variables, special focus was given to three schools in Ramallah, which is a unique enclave that encompasses within it the socio-spatial realities of other enclaves in the West Bank. Taking from the lessons of each school system, it is concluded that new learning environments in the Occupied Palestinian Territories must positively respond to the bleak structures of the occupation by becoming programmatically diverse, architecturally innovative, and spatially integrated in order to create new and less insular cultural centers of which the students and communities can be proud. This thesis concludes with recommendations for educationalists, architects and development professionals that stem from revelations in the historical analysis and results from the architectural analysis. Learning environments must span outwards allowing for an expansion of school resources, a broadening of learning experiences for youth, and the unification of Palestinians in order to improve the socio-spatial disorder of the occupation.by Jenine Kotob.S.M.in Architecture Studie", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/18321273.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18321273.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/18321273", "http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/82163"]}, {"authors": ["E-Finance Lab <Frankfurt, Main>"], "title": "EFL quarterly : an E-Finance Lab publication ; 3/2013", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["periodicalpart", "doc-type:periodicalpart"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/18325701.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18325701.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/18325701", "http://nbn-resolving.de/urn/resolver.pl?urn:nbn:de:hebis:30:3-319365", "https://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/frontdoor/index/index/docId/31936", "https://publikationen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/files/31936/print13-3.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Luitel, Bal Chandra", "Rai, Indra Mani", "Gautam, Suresh", "Pant, Binod Prasad", "Gautam, Santosh"], "title": "The Educational Resilience of Children in Urban Squatter Settlements of Kathmandu", "description": "Nepal is a partner to the international commitment to achieve the goals of Education for All (EFA) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Efforts have been made through the EFA National Plan of Action 2003-2015 and School Sector Reform Program (SSRP) to achieve the EFA goals and the MDGs. Over the last few years, Nepal has demonstrated progress in some of the indicators related to children s participation in school. The Department of Education (2012) has reported that the primary education Net Enrolment Rate (NER), Grade 1 Net Intake Rate (NIR), Grade 5 Survival Rate (SR), and Dropout Rate (DR), are 95.3, 91.2, 84.1, and 5.2 percent respectively. However, it will be difficult to close the bigger gaps of 4.7, 8.8, 15.9, and 5.2 percent of the NER, NIR, SR, and DR respectively by 2015. The challenge lies in the large number of school-aged children who do not attend formal primary schooling. Likewise, a significant number of students repeat grades and those promoted may have low achievement. Realizing this bleak educational scenario, Nepal has been focusing more on access to quality education for the children of economically marginalized people through equity measures (scholarships and incentives). These children belong to the poorest groups (Wagley, September 2013, The Himalayan Times), such as the disadvantaged and the deprived communities of urban squatter settlements. Many reasons have been identified for the phenomenon of out-of-school children, including poor family economic conditions, an unfavorable school environment, socio-cultural beliefs and traditions, parents not recognizing the importance of education, inaccessible schools for children with disabilities, parents unwillingness, corporal punishment and children s domestic responsibilities (Scheuermann 2013). Other factors listed as contributing to primary level dropout are violence in school such as corporal punishment by teachers (Nepal, DoE 2010), children s domestic responsibilities, and an unfavorable school environment (Nepal, DoE 2012). In this context, in particular, children in urban squatter settlements face more severe adversities and risks as most are deprived of government services because of a lack of official national identification", "datePublished": "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.11588/xarep.00003689", "publisher": "'American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)'", "subjects": ["Working paper", "info:eu-repo/semantics/workingPaper", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/33423458.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33423458.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/33423458", "http://crossasia-repository.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/3689/1/942690WP00PUBL0RA00program0RR0Nepal.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Vatuva gwaa-Uugwanga, Paulina Ndahambelela"], "title": "Teacher educators' perceptions about possibilities and challenges of the merger between Namibian Higher Education institutions for improving teacher education", "description": "Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of the teacher educators about the merger between the University of Namibia and Namibia\u2019s former Colleges of Education with regards to the merger's capacity to improve quality teacher education. The focus of the study differed from the various merger studies in that theirs has mainly been on technical issues of mergers to interpret merger capacity to improve change. Of importance about this focus is that the views of teacher educators were deemed important because of their 'agency' in the merger and its capacity to improve teacher education quality. The grounded theory of Strauss and Corbin of 1998 framed the study. The key question of the study was: \"what are the perceptions of teacher educators about the merger of the former colleges of education with the University of Namibia's and the capacity to improve teacher education quality in the country?\" A case study methodology was employed in which semi-structured questions were used to collect data. In addition, the study also employed observations and document analysis as sources of data.The key finding of the study was that all the participants' perceptions were that the merger has the capacity to improve the quality of teacher education in Namibia. The core of this finding serves as evidence of the complexities of mergers, particularly in terms of how participants perceive the merger's capability of improving quality. Firstly, the perceptions related to the contexts in which the participant teacher educators found themselves. Furthermore, the perceptions appeared to be associated with various contextual needs experienced by participants in the various institutions. The study analysis further suggested that the needs related to issues associated with input, process and output. These findings laid the ground for an emergent theory for understanding of teacher educators\u2019 perceptions about the mergers.

Etter gjennomf\u00f8rt Bachelor i HR og Personalledelse ser vi for oss at mye av kunnskapen vi har f\u00e5tt kan v\u00e6re nyttig i arbeidslivet i ledelse av menneskelige ressurser. Dette ledet oss til en hypotese om at personalledere i IT-bransjen med lederutdanning ser st\u00f8rre hensikt med strategisk utf\u00f8relse av HR-aktiviteter enn de uten. Derav kommer problemstillingen for oppgaven: \u201cHva betyr utdanningsbakgrunn for personallederes utf\u00f8relse av HR-aktiviteter i norske IT-bedrifter?\u201d Oppgaven tar for seg den enkelte leders tiln\u00e6rming til personallederrollen og HR-aktivitetene. Vi har benyttet kvalitativ metode fordi vi \u00f8nsket \u00e5 f\u00e5 en dypere forst\u00e5else rundt temaet og finne bakenforliggende m\u00f8nstre og \u00e5rsaker til hva som p\u00e5virker HR-arbeidet og betydningen av utdanningsbakgrunn. V\u00e5rt teoretiske rammeverk er basert p\u00e5 teorier og forskning p\u00e5 HR og personalledelse, herunder HR-aktiviteter, strategisk ledelse og lederatferd, noe som har v\u00e6rt grunnlaget i utarbeidelsen av v\u00e5r intervjuguide og for \u00e5 svare p\u00e5 problemstillingen. Funnene i v\u00e5rt utvalg viser at utdanningsbakgrunn har betydning for utf\u00f8relsen av noen HR-aktiviteter, s\u00e6rlig kompetanseutvikling og medarbeidersamtaler, der ledere med lederutdanning har en mer strukturert tiln\u00e6rming til disse enn ledere med fagutdanning eller mindre lederutdanning. I tillegg fant vi at ledere med lederutdanning har st\u00f8rre fokus p\u00e5 bruk av verdier i forbindelse med lederstrategi og har st\u00f8rre kunnskap om betydningen av indre motivasjon. Fagkompetanse og lederkompetanse er i stor grad komplement\u00e6re. I tunge fagmilj\u00f8er er sterk IT-kunnskap n\u00e6rmest forventet av en leder. Imidlertid kan lederutdanning ses p\u00e5 som en indikasjon p\u00e5 lederens interesse for ledelse som fagfelt. Ledere i v\u00e5rt utvalg med lederutdanning er i st\u00f8rre grad opptatt av det organisatoriske. Ledere med mindre formell lederkompetanse er mer opptatt av det faglige og mindre innstilt p\u00e5 \u00e5 ta p\u00e5 seg flere personaloppgaver. Samtidig er lederskap noe som er uavhengig av utdanningsbakgrunn.

In a distributed search engine several nodes collaborate in handling the search\noperations. Usually each node is only responsible for one or a few parts of the index\nused for storing and searching. These smaller index parts are usually referred to as\nshards.\nLately ElasticSearch has emerged as a popular distributed search engine intended for\nmedium- and large scale searching. An ElasticSearch cluster could potentially consist of\na lot of nodes and shards. Sending a search query to all nodes and shards might result\nin high latency when the size of the cluster is large or when the nodes are far apart\nfrom each other. ElasticSearch provides some features for limiting the number of nodes\nwhich participate in each search query in special cases, but generally each query will be\nprocessed by all nodes and shards.\nShard selection is a method used to only forward queries to the shards which are estimated\nto be highly relevant to a query. In this thesis a shard selection plugin called\nSAFE has been developed for ElasticSearch. SAFE implements four state of the art\nshard selection algorithms and supports all current query types in ElasticSearch. The\npurpose of SAFE is to further increase the scalability of ElasticSearch by limiting the\nnumber of nodes which participate in each search query. The cost of using the plugin is\nthat there might be a negative e ect on the search results.\nThe purpose of this thesis has been to evaluate to which extent SAFE a ects the search\nresults in ElasticSearch. The four implemented algorithms have been compared in three\ndi erent experiments using two di erent data sets. Two new metrics called Pk@N and\nModi ed Recall have been developed for this thesis which measures the relative performance\nbetween exhaustive search and shard selection in a search engine like Elastic-\nSearch.\nThe results indicate that three algorithms in SAFE perform very well when documents\nare distributed to shards depending on which linguistic topic they belong to. However if\ndocuments are randomly allocated to shards, which is the standard approach in Elastic-\nSearch, then SAFE does not show any signi cant results and seems to be unusable.\nThis thesis shows that if a suitable document distribution policy is used and there is a\ntolerance for losing some relevant documents in the search results then a shard selection\nimplementations like SAFE could be used to further increase the scalability of a\ndistributed search engine, especially in a low resource environment", "datePublished": "2014-09-19T00:00:00", "subjects": ["H2"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/43556976.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/43556976.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/43556976", "http://hdl.handle.net/2077/36976"]}, {"authors": ["Bureau of International Labor Affairs"], "title": "2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor", "description": "[Excerpt] This report is divided into five parts.

Both the use of computer simulations and traditional teaching was teacher centred. The study was done in a rural area in South Africa, in the Limpopo Province in the district of Vhembe. The theoretical framework was based on the information processing model. Within the non-equivalent quasi experimental design a switching replications design study was used whereby 105 learners in four schools took part. This study found that in terms of the acquisition of knowledge, female learners gained more by the use of simulations than their male counterparts. No significant effect was found in the acquisition of the skill when computer simulations were used. Initial reduction of cognitive load was found when simulations were used and with time this increased. Experienced educators reduced the cognitive load through use of their knowledge and expertise and their role needs to be highlighted. Further studies are suggested to study the effect of a learner centred approach on decreasing the cognitive load and its effect on the acquisition of knowledge and skills.Mathematics, Science and Technology EducationD.

It has a population of more than 150 million people, with three major languages, namely Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, and a number of minority languages. Despite its linguistic and cultural diversity, English is the main medium of instruction from primary to tertiary education. The negative effects of learning through the medium of English second language (L2) are evidenced in the learners\u2019 poor achievement in the external examination results of the National Examination Council (NECO) and the West African Examination Council (WAEC). There is an assumption that learners\u2019 poor performance in English (L2) is due to little attention given to English writing in schools, and the use of less appropriate or effective teaching approaches (Babalola, 2011). There is a special concern about the poor writing proficiency levels of learners, particularly in the Junior Secondary School (JSS) phase which is an exit to Senior Secondary School level where learners are expected to show strong academic literacy skills. Writing is a process which is central to learners\u2019 learning across the curriculum and it enables learners not only to access knowledge from different sources, but also to display the acquired knowledge in different domains. Learners\u2019 poor writing skills are a great concern given that English (L2) is the main medium of instruction at all levels of education in Nigeria. In light of the above, this study set out to explore the pedagogical strategies and problems encountered by both teachers and learners in English (L2) academic writing in Junior Secondary School (JSS 3) classrooms in the Ekiti State, Nigeria. Guided by Second Language Acquisition theory, the study explored the factors that influence second language learning, in relation to the sociocultural and contextual factors that influence learners\u2019 writing abilities. Through the lens of the Genre Pedagogical Theory and the Social Constructivist theory, it investigated teachers\u2019 pedagogical strategies in English (L2) writing, and analysed learners\u2019 written texts in order to understand the extent to which they reflected the features of specific genres that support learners\u2019 writing skills. Four JSS3 teachers in three schools were purposively selected to participate in the study. The study employed a qualitative research paradigm, underpinned by the interpretive theory. Through the use of an ethnographic design, the day-to-day happenings such as thoughts and engagements of both teachers and students in the English (L2) lessons were observed and recorded by means of an audio-recorder in order to build a comprehensive record of the participants\u2019 practice in the classroom. In addition, both semi-structured and unstructured interviews were conducted with the individual teachers. The students\u2019 written texts and other relevant documents were collected and analysed for the purpose of data triangulation. Ethical considerations such as informed consent, voluntary participation, respect and anonymity of participants were observed throughout the study. In this study, the findings show that the teaching of English (L2) writing is still a challenge to many teachers due to a variety of factors which include linguistic, pedagogical and structural factors. As a result, learners\u2019 academic writing suffers, especially writing to learn at secondary school level. Specifically, the findings of this study indicate that the teachers made use of traditional teaching approaches in the teaching of English (L2) writing as against the approaches recommended in the curriculum. The study also reveals that most of the JSS(3) students\u2019 level of proficiency in English writing is below the expected levels stipulated in the curriculum document, although some of them displayed good basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS), Other contributing factors to the learners\u2019 low academic writing proficiency in English (L2) include teachers\u2019 limited understanding and application of the Genre-Based Approach in teaching writing, inadequate language teaching and learning resources, learners\u2019 limited exposure to English (L2) and limited writing opportunities. The study concludes that while the use of the Genre-Based Approach is not the only strategy to enhance learners\u2019 writing skills, the teaching of writing remains crucial as it is central to language use in different knowledge domains. Students\u2019 writing proficiency is critical for cognitive and socio-economic development as it has implications for students\u2019 access to knowledge and academic literacy which spills over to tertiary education. In a country like Nigeria where the main language of instruction is English, there is a need to prioritise teacher \r\ndevelopment and to revisit the curriculum to determine how it meets the academic needs of learners in this century", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "'University of the Western Cape Library Service'", "subjects": ["Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP)", "Junior Secondary School (JSS)", "Writing", "English", "Nigeria"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/58915990.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/58915990.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/58915990", "http://hdl.handle.net/11394/5089"]}, {"authors": ["Awantara, I Gede"], "title": "Analisis data navigasi wahana bergerak dengan metode Kalman Filtering", "description": "Sitem navigasi merupakan sistem yang digunakan untuk memandu perjalanan wahana dari suatu tempat ke suatu tujuan tertentu, dengan menggunakan perangkat peta digital dan informasi posisi dengan menggunakan satelit GPS (Global Positioning System).

Many research efforts have been focused on fault diagnosis and detection of roller bearings, since they constitute one the most important elements of rotating machinery. In this study a combination method is proposed for early damage detection of roller bearing.  Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is applied to the collected data for denoising and the resulting clean data are break-down into some elementary components called Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The normalized energy of three first IMFs are used as input for Support vector machine (SVM) to recognize whether signals are sorting out from healthy or faulty bearings. Then, since there is no robust guide to determine amplitude of added noise in EEMD technique, a new Performance improved EEMD (PIEEMD) is proposed to determine the appropriate value of added noise. A novel feature extraction method is also proposed for detecting small size defect using Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). TKEO is applied to IMFs obtained to create new feature vectors as input data for one-class SVM. The results of applying the method to acceleration signals collected from an experimental bearing test rig demonstrated that the method can be successfully used for early damage detection of roller bearings.\nMost of the diagnostic methods that have been developed up to now can be applied for the case stationary working conditions only (constant speed and load). However, bearings often work at time-varying conditions such as wind turbine supporting bearings, mining excavator bearings, vehicles, robots and all processes with run-up and run-down transients. Damage identification for bearings working under non-stationary operating conditions, especially for early/small defects, requires the use of appropriate techniques, which are generally different from those used for the case of stationary conditions, in order to extract fault-sensitive features which are at the same time insensitive to operational condition variations. Some methods have been proposed for damage detection of bearings working under time-varying speed conditions. However, their application might increase the instrumentation cost because of providing a phase reference signal. Furthermore, some methods such as order tracking methods still can be applied when the speed variation is limited. In this study, a novel combined method based on cointegration is proposed for the development of fault features which are sensitive to the presence of defects while in the same time they are insensitive to changes in the operational conditions. It does not require any additional measurements and can identify defects even for considerable speed variations. The signals acquired during run-up condition are decomposed into IMFs using the performance improved EEMD method. Then, the cointegration method is applied to the intrinsic mode functions to extract stationary residuals. The feature vectors are created by applying the Teager-Kaiser energy operator to the obtained stationary residuals. Finally, the feature vectors of the healthy bearing signals are utilized to construct a separating hyperplane using one-class support vector machine. Eventually the proposed method was applied to vibration signals measured on an experimental bearing test rig. The results verified that the method can successfully distinguish between healthy and faulty bearings even if the shaft speed changes dramatically", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "doi": "10.6092/polito/porto/2598388", "publisher": "Politecnico di Torino", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234905082.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/234905082.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/234905082", "http://hdl.handle.net/11583/2598388"]}, {"authors": ["Abdulaziz , Bagiev"], "title": "Visual-Tactile Image Representation For The Visually Impaired Using Braille Device", "description": "Nowadays Internet usage is dramatically increasing all over the world and the information dissemination and acquisition is easier for sighted users.

PD cells accumulate massive quantities of glycogen within their lysosomes, and as such, PD is classified as a \u201clysosomal storage disease\u201d (LSD). GAA-deficient cells also exhibit accumulation of autophagic debris. Symptoms of severe infantile PD include extreme muscle weakness, hypotonia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, resulting in death before one year of age.  \r\nCertain LSDs are currently being successfully treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which involves intravenous infusion of a recombinant enzyme to counteract the endogenous deficiency.  ERT has been less successful in PD, however, due to ineffective delivery of the recombinant enzyme.  Alternatively, specific genes deletion may reduce lysosomal glycogen load, and could thus be targeted in PD therapy development. Absence of malin (EPM2B) or laforin (EPM2A) has been proposed to impair autophagy, which could reduce lysosomal glycogen levels.  Additionally, deficiency of Stbd1 has been postulated to disable lysosomal glycogen import.  Furthermore, Ptg deficiency was previously reported to abrogate Lafora body formation and correct neurological abnormalities in Lafora disease mouse models and could have similar effects on PD pathologies.  \r\n The goal of this study was to characterize the effects of homozygous disruption of Epm2a, Epm2b, Stbd1, and Ptg loci on total glycogen levels in PD mouse model heart tissue, as in severe infantile PD, it is accumulation of glycogen in the heart that results in fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Gaa-/- mice were intercrossed with Epm2a-/-, Epm2b-/-, Stbd1-/-, and Ptg-/- mice to generate wildtype (WT), single knockout, and double knockout mice.  The results indicated that Gaa-/- hearts accumulated up to 100-fold more glycogen than the WT. These mice also displayed cardiac hypertrophy. However, deficiency of Epm2a, Epm2b, Stbd1, or PTG in the Gaa-/- background did not reveal changes of statistical significance in either heart glycogen or cardiac hypertrophy.  Nevertheless, since total glycogen was measured, these deficiencies should not be discarded in future discussions of PD therapy, as increasing sample sizes and/or distinguishing cytosolic from lysosomal glycogen content may yet reveal differences of greater significance", "datePublished": "2015-08-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.7912/C2Z598", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/46960467.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/46960467.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/46960467", "http://hdl.handle.net/1805/7979"]}, {"authors": ["Avner, Judith"], "title": "Some Observations On State Equal Rights Amendments", "description": "Since 1970, sixteen states have added equal rights amendments to their constitutions.

The model, which is conceptually the simplest, is based on the infinite sites assumption, that is no character can mutate more than once in the whole tree. A main open problem regarding the model is finding generalizations that retain the computational tractability of the original model but are more flexible in modeling biological data when the infinite site assumption is violated because of e.g. back mutations. A special case of back mutations that has been considered in the study of the evolution of protein domains (where a domain is acquired and then lost) is persistency, that is the fact that a character is allowed to return back to the ancestral state. In this model characters can be gained and lost at most once. In this paper we consider the computational problem of explaining binary data by the Persistent Perfect Phylogeny model (referred as PPP) and for this purpose we investigate the problem of reconstructing an evolution where some constraints are imposed on the paths of the tree.\nRESULTS: \nWe define a natural generalization of the PPP problem obtained by requiring that for some pairs (character, species), neither the species nor any of its ancestors can have the character. In other words, some characters cannot be persistent for some species. This new problem is called Constrained PPP (CPPP). Based on a graph formulation of the CPPP problem, we are able to provide a polynomial time solution for the CPPP problem for matrices whose conflict graph has no edges. Using this result, we develop a parameterized algorithm for solving the CPPP problem where the parameter is the number of characters.\nCONCLUSIONS: \nA preliminary experimental analysis shows that the constrained persistent perfect phylogeny model allows to explain efficiently data that do not conform with the classical perfect phylogeny model", "datePublished": "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-15-S6-S10", "publisher": "'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/article"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/187929580.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/187929580.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/187929580", "http://hdl.handle.net/2434/252617"]}, {"authors": ["Puig Dur\u00e1n, Mart\u00ed"], "title": "Methodology for the selection and implementation of environmental aspects and performance indicators in ports", "description": "It is broadly known that efficient ports are crucial for the economic development of their surrounding area.

These included embedding science research in\nthe curriculum, requiring participation in science research for all students, flexible scheduling and offering elective science research classes.

The study was informed by a literature review of local and international sources related to theoretical perspectives on instructional leadership, the features of instructional leadership that impact on learner achievement and selected models of instructional leadership. An overview of contextual and school factors which shape primary school learner achievement in South Africa with reference to the rural and township communities also framed the empirical inquiry. A mixed method study was conducted according to two phases: Phase 1 comprised the quantitative component (questionnaires); Phase 2 comprised the qualitative component (interviews). Both phases were conducted in the Tshwane South District, Gauteng Province. In both phases data were gathered from primary school principals and Institute Development Support Officials (IDSOs) selected by random and purposeful sampling respectively. The questionnaire findings indicated that the principals and IDSOs had adequate qualifications and experience, and that key school policies are in place. However, the principals are less confident about policy implementation, particularly with regard to educator and learner discipline. They face many systemic problems, such as inadequate school resources and additional funds in no fee-paying schools to improve the infrastructure and reduce the learner-teacher ratios. The findings from the interviews indicated that the principals struggle to maintain participative management with the school governing bodies; are hampered by contextual factors, especially poor school infrastructure; and are challenged to meet the requirements of annual benchmarking assessments. Based on the findings of the literature study and the empirical inquiry recommendations are made to improve practice, including a call for the professional development of principals in project management and fundraising.Educational Leadership and ManagementD.

This problem has been the object of many studies and extensions in heterogeneous domains such as: speech recognition, social network analysis, biological sequence alignment, path planning, or zero-sum games among others. Although the shortest path focuses on the optimal cost of reaching a destination node, it does not take into account other useful information contained on the graph, such as the degree of connectivity of two nodes. On the other hand, measures taking connectivity information into account have their own drawbacks, specially when graphs become large. A new family of distances which interpolates between both extremes is introduced by the Randomized Shortest Path (RSP) framework. By spreading randomization through a graph, the RSP leads to applications where some degree of randomness would be desired. Through this work, we try to investigate whether the RSP framework can be applied to different domains in which randomization is useful, and either solve an existing problem with a new approach, or prove to outperform existing methods.(FSA - Sciences de l'ing\u00e9nieur) -- UCL, 201", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/34090206.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34090206.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/34090206", "http://hdl.handle.net/2078.1/165618"]}, {"authors": ["Lumadi, Mutendwahothe Walter"], "title": "Building a Conducive Learning Environment in Dysfunctional Schools: A Curriculum Development Tool", "description": "The dearth of expertise in mathematics and science in South African schools in general and in the Limpopo province in particular is a daunting task.

Urban underground infrastructures deal with variables such as cost, duration, safety, and management; faces political, social, economic and environmental issues; and guarantees future sustainability, maintenance, and energy efficiency. To do so, all these concepts and variables must be kept in mind during the whole construction process: (I) project design, (II) project construction and (III) project exploitation. This thesis aims to demonstrate how the construction cycle deals with the various impacts produced by the interaction of underground constructions with groundwater at each stage of the process, with a view to providing improved processes. During the project design previous data is collected, new data is generated, created and processed, helping to understand\r\nthe context and to design the infrastructure. There are very advanced tools to store and process hydrogeological data, but most of these tools are not common in infrastructure projects. Often most of the constructions only perform the minimum\r\nlegal requirement to characterize the ground: a pumping test. Therefore, there is a need to provide the constructors with a set of methods and tools to allow them to increase the quality of their hydrogeological analysis, which will allow early detection problems associated with the groundwater.\r\n\r\nThe interaction of underground constructions with groundwater generates impacts. These impacts can usually be minimized by using mitigation measures. The most common impacts caused by underground constructions are the groundwater barrier effect and the groundwater pressure distribution and limitation under the bottom slab. In the literature there are many examples and designs to mitigate both groundwater barrier effect and groundwater pressure distribution impacts. However, there is no design that integrates both solutions. This thesis presents an innovative groundwater by-pass design that enables the groundwater to flow through the structure and provide a homogenous distribution of the water pressure under the bottom slab. The new integrated design was applied to the largest underground infrastructure of Barcelona: La Sagrera railway station. A hydrogeological model was implemented to test the original and the integrated designs in three different scenarios. This new solution mitigates the groundwater barrier effect and optimizes the bottom slab, considerably reducing the costs and increasing safety during the construction phase. \r\n\r\nMonitoring is required when dewatering underground constructions in order to anticipate unexpected events and preserve nearby existing structures. The most accurate and spread monitoring method to measure displacements is levelling, a pointlike surveying technique that typically allows for tens of discrete in-situ sub-millimetric measurements per squared kilometer.\r\nAnother emerging technique for mapping soil deformation is the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which is based on SAR images acquired from orbiting satellites or by ground-based stations (GB-SAR). This remote sensing technique can provide better spatial point density than levelling, more extensive spatial coverage and cheaper acquisitions. Both satellite and ground-based SAR systems have been used and tested in a variety of analyses. However, nobody has applied this technology as a monitoring tool during construction works yet. This thesis contributes to data storing and data analysis software that implies new and significant method developments for increasing the quality of the hydrogeological analysis; it provides new approaches to address the groundwater corrective\r\nmeasures definition during the design stage, and it develops and applies new methods of nfrastructure monitoring using ground-based and satellite SAR sensors during the construction stage.Degut al creixement exponencial de la poblaci\u00f3 i tenint en compte que l'espai dins les \u00e0rees urbanes \u00e9s finit \u00e9s, necessari la construcci\u00f3 d'infraestructures subterr\u00e0nies. Variables com el cost, la durada, la seguretat i la gesti\u00f3; els problemes pol\u00edtics, socials, econ\u00f2mics i ambientals; garantir la sostenibilitat futura, el manteniment i l'efici\u00e8ncia energ\u00e8tica, han d'estar presents durant totes les fases del proc\u00e9s constructiu: (I) fase de disseny, (II) fase de construcci\u00f3, i (III) fase d'explotaci\u00f3. Les construccions subterr\u00e0nies interactuen amb el medi subterrani, el resultat de la interacci\u00f3 s\u00f3n uns impactes en la construcci\u00f3 i en el medi ambient. Tots aquests impactes s\u00f3n avaluats al llarg del proc\u00e9s constructiu per tal de ser corregits o minimitzats. L'objectiu principal d'aquesta tesi \u00e9s con\u00e8ixer com s'avaluen els diferents impactes a cadascuna de les fas es del proc\u00e9s constructiu per poder aix\u00ed proposar millores. Durant el disseny del projecte i per tal d'entendre el context i el disseny de la infraestructura es recullen dades hist\u00f2riques i es generen noves dades . L'\u00fas de la majoria d'eines hidrogeol\u00f2giques no \u00e9s habitual en els projectes d'infraestructures ja que la majoria caracteritzen el terreny amb una prova de bombament. Per tant, \u00e9s necessari proporcionar als constructors un conjunt de m\u00e8todes i d'eines que permetin augmentar la qualitat dels seus an\u00e0lisis, per augmentar aix\u00ed la detecci\u00f3 primerenca de problemes associats a les aig\u00fces subterr\u00e0nies. Els impactes produ\u00efts per la interacci\u00f3 de les construccions subterr\u00e0nies amb les aig\u00fces subterr\u00e0nies es poden minimitzar mitjan\u00e7ant l'\u00fas de mesures de mitigaci\u00f3. Els impactes m\u00e9s comuns causats per construccions subterr\u00e0nies s\u00f3n l'efecte barrera i la distribuci\u00f3 i limitaci\u00f3 de subpressions sota la llosa de fons. A la literatura hi ha molts dissenys que permeten mitigar l'efecte barrera i millorar la distribuci\u00f3 de les subpressions, per\u00f2 no hi ha cap disseny que integri les dues solucions. Aquesta tesi presenta un disseny innovador per bypassar les aig\u00fces subterr\u00e0nies a trav\u00e9s de l'estructura proporcionant una distribuci\u00f3 homog\u00e8nia de les subpressions sota la llosa de fons. Aquesta nova soluci\u00f3 minimitza l'efecte barrera de les aig\u00fces subterr\u00e0nies i optimitza la llosa de fons, reduint considerablement els costos i augmentant la seguretat durant la fase de construcci\u00f3. Quan una construcci\u00f3 rebaixa el nivell fre\u00e0tic cal auscultar els nivells i la deformaci\u00f3 del terreny per tal d'anticipar esdeveniments inesperats i preservar les estructures properes existents. El m\u00e8tode actual m\u00e9s utilitzat per mesurar despla\u00e7aments \u00e9s l'anivellament, que permet avaluar in situ desenes de punts discrets amb una precisi \u00f3 submil\u00b7lim\u00e8trica. Una t\u00e8cnica emergent \u00e9s el Radar d'Obertura Sint\u00e8tica Interferom\u00e8trica (InSAR), que es basa en imatges SAR adquirides des de sat\u00e8l\u00b7lits en \u00f2rbita o b\u00e9 des d'estacions al terra (GB-SAR). Aquesta t\u00e8cnica de detecci\u00f3 remota proporciona una major cobertura espacial i m\u00e9s econ\u00f2mica que els m\u00e8todes d'auscultaci\u00f3 tradicionals. Tot i que la tecnologia SAR s'ha utilitzat i validat en una gran varietat d'an\u00e0lisis, ning\u00fa ha aplicat encara aquesta tecnologia com a eina d'auscultaci\u00f3 durant la construcci\u00f3 d'infraestructures. Aquesta tesi contribueix a: (I) millorar l'emmagatzematge i processament de dades a trav\u00e9s de nous desenvolupaments i m\u00e8todes que permeten augmentar la qualitat de l'an\u00e0lisi hidrogeol\u00f2gica; (II) oferir noves formes d'an\u00e0lisi per al disseny de mesures correctores durant l'etapa de disseny; i (III) desenvolupar i aplicar nous m\u00e8todes d'auscultaci\u00f3 d'infraestructura a trav\u00e9s de sensors SAR (terrestres i sat\u00e8l\u00b7lit) durant la fase constructiva.La limitaci\u00f3n de espacio en \u00e1reas urbanas junto al crecimiento exponencial de la poblaci\u00f3n, hace necesaria la\r\nconstrucci\u00f3n de infraestructuras subterr\u00e1neas. Nuevos conceptos en planificaci\u00f3n urbana junto con los\r\navances tecnol\u00f3gicos en la construcci\u00f3n hacen posible la ejecuci\u00f3n de infraestructuras m\u00e1s grandes y de m\u00e1s\r\neficiencia. No obstante, variables tales como el coste, la duraci\u00f3n, la seguridad y la gesti\u00f3n; los problemas\r\npol\u00edticos, sociales, econ\u00f3micos y ambientales; y garantizar la sostenibilidad futura, el mantenimiento y la\r\neficiencia energ\u00e9tica, hacen de esta ejecuci\u00f3n un problema complejo. Por ello, todas estas variables deben\r\nestar presentes durante todo el proceso constructivo: (I) dise\u00f1o del proyecto, (II) construcci\u00f3n del proyecto y\r\n(III) explotaci\u00f3n del proyecto. Esta tesis tiene como objetivo principal saber c\u00f3mo el ciclo constructivo (dise\u00f1o\r\ndel proyecto, construcci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n de proyectos) procesa las problem\u00e1ticas inducidas por la\r\ninteracci\u00f3n de las nuevas infraestructuras subterr\u00e1neas urbanas con las aguas subterr\u00e1neas para luego\r\nmejorarlo.\r\nDurante el dise\u00f1o del proyecto (fase I) se recogen los datos hist\u00f3ricos, se generan nuevos datos (pozos,\r\npruebas de campo, muestras qu\u00edmicas ...) y se procesa conjuntamente, lo que ayuda a entender el contexto y\r\nel dise\u00f1o de la infraestructura. Existen herramientas muy avanzadas para almacenar y procesar informaci\u00f3n\r\ngeol\u00f3gica, hidroqu\u00edmica e hidrogeol\u00f3gica, aunque la mayor\u00eda de estas herramientas no son comunes en los proyectos de infraestructuras subterr\u00e1neas ya que es com\u00fan que la mayor\u00eda de las construcciones s\u00f3lo se\r\nrealice una prueba de bombeo para caracterizar el subsuelo. Por lo tanto, hay una necesidad de proporcionar\r\nun conjunto de m\u00e9todos y de herramientas a los constructores para que puedan aumentar la calidad de su\r\nan\u00e1lisis (como pruebas de bombeo), para aumentar as\u00ed la detecci\u00f3n temprana de problemas asociados a las\r\naguas subterr\u00e1neas.\r\nLa interacci\u00f3n de las construcciones subterr\u00e1neas con las aguas subterr\u00e1neas genera impactos. Estos impactos\r\ngeneralmente pueden minimizarse mediante el uso de medidas correctoras. Los impactos m\u00e1s comunes\r\ncausados por las construcciones subterr\u00e1neas son el efecto barrera (impacto en las aguas subterr\u00e1neas) y la\r\ndistribuci\u00f3n y limitaci\u00f3n de subpresiones bajo la losa de fondo (impacto en la construcci\u00f3n subterr\u00e1nea). En la\r\nliteratura hay muchos ejemplos de dise\u00f1os para mitigar tanto el efecto barrera y como para mejorar la\r\ndistribuci\u00f3n de las subpresiones bajo la losa de fondo. Sin embargo, no hay ning\u00fan dise\u00f1o que integre ambas\r\nsoluciones. Es il\u00f3gico dise\u00f1ar una medida correctora sin tener en cuenta todos los factores que intervienen en\r\nel problema. Esta tesis presenta un dise\u00f1o innovador de by-pass para las aguas subterr\u00e1neas que permite el\r\nflujo de agua subterr\u00e1nea a trav\u00e9s de la estructura a la vez que proporciona una distribuci\u00f3n homog\u00e9nea de\r\nlas subpresiones bajo la losa de fondo. El nuevo dise\u00f1o se ha aplicado en la infraestructura subterr\u00e1nea m\u00e1s\r\ngrande de Barcelona: la futura estaci\u00f3n de tren de La Sagrera. Se ha realizado un modelo hidrogeol\u00f3gico para\r\nprobar los nuevos dise\u00f1os en tres escenarios diferentes. Esta nueva soluci\u00f3n mitiga el efecto barrera de las\r\naguas subterr\u00e1neas y optimiza la losa de fondo, lo que reduce considerablemente los costes y aumenta la\r\nseguridad durante la fase de construcci\u00f3n.\r\nDurante la construcci\u00f3n (fase II) se genera una gran cantidad de nuevos datos. Es necesario auscultar los\r\nniveles y la deformaci\u00f3n del terreno cuando una construcci\u00f3n rebaja el fre\u00e1tico con el fin de anticiparse a\r\nacontecimientos inesperados y a preservar las estructuras y / o edificios cercanos existentes. El m\u00e9todo actual\r\nm\u00e1s usado para medir desplazamientos en el terreno es la nivelaci\u00f3n, una t\u00e9cnica que permite evaluar in situ\r\ndecenas de puntos discretos con una precisi\u00f3n sub-milim\u00e9trica. Una t\u00e9cnica emergente para medir la\r\ndeformaci\u00f3n del suelo es el Radar de Apertura Sint\u00e9tica Interferom\u00e9trica (InSAR), que se basa en im\u00e1genes\r\nSAR adquiridas o bien desde sat\u00e9lites en \u00f3rbita o bien desde estaciones en tierra (GB-SAR). Esta t\u00e9cnica de\r\ndetecci\u00f3n remota proporciona una mayor cobertura espacial y m\u00e1s barata que los m\u00e9todos de auscultaci\u00f3n\r\ntradicionales. Aunque la tecnolog\u00eda SAR se ha utilizado y validado en una gran variedad de an\u00e1lisis, nadie ha\r\naplicado esta tecnolog\u00eda como una herramienta de auscultaci\u00f3n durante la construcci\u00f3n de infraestructuras.\r\nEsta tesis contribuye a mejorar el almacenamiento y tratamiento de datos a trav\u00e9s de nuevos desarrollos y\r\nm\u00e9todos que permiten aumentar la calidad del an\u00e1lisis hidrogeol\u00f3gico; ofrece nuevas formas de an\u00e1lisis para\r\nel dise\u00f1o de medidas correctoras durante la etapa de dise\u00f1o; y desarrolla y aplica nuevos m\u00e9todos de\r\nauscultaci\u00f3n de infraestructura a trav\u00e9s de sensores SAR (terrestres y sat\u00e9lite) durante la fase constructivaPostprint (published version", "datePublished": "2016-07-22T00:00:00", "publisher": "Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya", "subjects": ["Doctoral thesis"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81578940.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/81578940", "http://hdl.handle.net/10803/398402", "http://hdl.handle.net/2117/98134"]}, {"authors": ["Simon J.

The problem addressed here is that schooling operates as a religious institution through its proffering a sacred cosmology around what I will conceptualize as \u201cThe Religion of the Marketplace\u201d that shapes students in the imago dei of the Homo Economicus whose hearts are shaped to worship the god, Mammon, by the disordered love of avarice to find peace, contentment, and happiness through the theology of consumption. This dissertation examines the schoolhouse as a liturgical institution, arguing not that schools should be religious, but rather that they are \u201cre-ligious\u201d (Baker and Letendre, 2005; Meyer, 2009) in that they bind us to what Charles Taylor (2004) describes as social imaginaries (ways of seeing and being in the world) that then become \u201creligious\u201d (held as sacred) for a given culture when they are legitimated, replicated and perpetuated through their specific pedagogies and practices.  Using exegesis of biblical texts and a historical exploration of the vice of avarice, I will argue that the cultivation of Mammon undermines both moral and political health because it erodes empathy and keeps one\u2019s focus on the disordered love (Augustine, 1958) of one\u2019s own self-gratification and \u2013glorification. This work seeks to address the moral, philosophical, political, and theological problems that are deeper than the issues addressed by the current public discourse on school reform. By theorizing the concepts of \u201cMammon\u201d and \u201cLiturgical Institutions\u201d (Smith, 2009), this inquiry explores the ways in which the Religion of the Marketplace shapes a theology of consumption that drives schooling, and the monstrous consequences of its so doing. This conceptualization opens the way to speak about the need for the school administrator to act as prophetic peace-weaver, the one tasked within the organization of a given school to usher in new modes of discourse and praxis in order to see not school reform, but school redemption occur", "datePublished": "2015-05-07T00:00:00", "subjects": ["school reform, education, schooling, prophetic imagination"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/215264229.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/215264229.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/215264229", "http://hdl.handle.net/11244/14627"]}, {"authors": ["Wee, Teck Chew"], "title": "Design and control of a humanoid robot", "description": "Design and control of the bipedal humanoid robot locomotion are challenging areas of research. Accurate models of the kinematics and dynamics of the robot are essential to achieve bipedal locomotion. Bipedal walking can be achieved either with flat-foot or toe-foot walking. Flat-foot walking is more stable but slower, whereas toe-foot walking produces more natural and faster motion. Furthermore in toe-foot walking it is possible to perform stretch knee walking. The mechanical structure of the robot is designed with compact modular parts so that the robot kinematics can be modelled as a multi-point-mass system, and its dynamics are modelled applying the inverted pendulum model and the zero-moment-point concept. The optimality in the gait trajectory is achieved exploiting augmented model predictive control methods taking into consideration the trade-off between walking speed and stability. The robustness and stability of the walking gaits and posture in the presence of internal or external disturbances are enhanced by adopting angular compensation with joint control techniques. The thesis develops a flat-foot optimal walking gait generation method. The effectiveness of the control technique and the passive-toe design is validated by simulation tests with the robot walking on slope, stepping over an obstacle and climbing a stair. The walking gaits are implemented on a mid-size (1.6 meter, 58 kg) bipedal robot. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the new proposed Augmented Model Predictive Control (AMPC) method has improved and produced a smoother gaits tracking trajectory in comparison with existing LQR and preview methods; and at the same time the proposed algorithms are able to reduce noise interference.Open Acces", "datePublished": "2014-12-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.25560/24436", "publisher": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London", "subjects": ["Thesis or dissertation", "Doctoral", "Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/76995315", "http://hdl.handle.net/10044/1/24436", "https://doi.org/10.25560/24436"]}, {"authors": ["Ammarah, Umme"], "title": "Education as a fundamental Human Right to Ensure Girls\u00b4 Participation and Quality of Education in Government Schools in Punjab, Pakistan A Comparative Mixed Method Research of Primary and Secondary Schools", "description": "The study focuses on analyzing a reform programme implemented in the Punjab province in Pakistan.

Despite all the efforts made by the people in the core and in periphery, and these improvements, the school education system still needs to be improved. Especially the primary schools need immediate attention to remove issues related to different reform provisions. The study made an attempt to study education policies and reforms from the inception of Pakistan. The purpose was to analyze the improvements in the education system as well as the reasons for its failure. The reform program studied specifically for the study has helped provide many education provisions at different levels of schooling. As a result of these efforts, the overall teaching/learning environment in the schools is improved. There are more students studying in the schools and graduating from schools to contribute to society and national economy effectively. However, there are still many areas that can be improved at different levels of schooling especially primary education. Primary education provides the very basis to the entire learning experience in schools and it is still in need of improvement. The primary schools need to improve girls\u00b4 access, providing facilities, qualified human resources, cleanliness in schools, and a child-centered and child-friendly teaching-learning environment. The individual attention can help improve their learning. For the medium of instructions in primary school, the school management needs to hire qualified teachers  form within the community, so that they are better able to communicate with the students in their mother tongue. Such issues allow girls students to drop out early and affect the learning of all students in primary schools. There are many good practices occurring in schools as a result of the reform programme but the government need to enhance these practices in schools. So that the overall impact of the reform improve school education experience by engaging students in innovative activities, such as, providing them computer literacy, arranging international competitive exams for the students, participating in debates, science project competitions at provincial and national level and cultural activities. Such activities have improved the learning experience of students. But the issues related to these activities and learning experience in primary schools needs to be improved. Therefore, the students can contribute to society as effective individuals", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis", "Studentarbeider"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/30905221.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/30905221.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/30905221", "https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/46218/1/Thesis-Masters-new-1.pdf", "http://hdl.handle.net/10852/46218", "www.duo.uio.no:10852/46218"]}, {"authors": ["Lu, J"], "title": "An investigation of university students' views about teaching and learning English through their own experiences in high schools and university of mainland China", "description": "English has become one of the most important subjects after the restoration of the College Entrance Examination in 1978 in mainland China. With the development of the Chinese economy and technology, Chinese students and graduates are provided with more opportunities to study and work collaboratively with the world community. Consequently, their English proficiency is closely related to their study and career plans. Therefore, it is important to investigate how students perceive their English learning and their teachers\u2019 teaching as this could both benefit students and teachers in an emerging discourse of English education.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate university students' perceptions about their teachers\u2019 teaching and their learning English through their own experiences in high schools and a university in mainland China. The investigation focused on the following key areas: the participants\u2019 perceptions of their English learning and teachers\u2019 teaching in high schools; the perceptions of their English learning and their teachers\u2019 teaching in the university; a comparative examination of these two learning discourses from the views of the students; and the participants\u2019 preferred learning and teaching models in the Chinese context.\n\nThis study employed both quantitative and qualitative research approaches for data collection and analysis. It included two phases: the questionnaire and semi- structured interviews. The statistical data were analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science) software version 21. The textual data collected from the semi-structured interviews were analyzed using the NVivo software version 10. Thematic analysis was used in the qualitative data analysis.\n\nThe results of this study indicated that huge differences of English teaching models utilized between high schools and universities existed in mainland China. This huge gap could create problems for Chinese students\u2019 learning transition and individual learning. The findings suggested that the current English assessments for both high schools students and university students should be improved, particularly, the English test in the College Entrance Examination. Meanwhile, transitional guidance was strongly suggested by university students, particularly, to take a shift from a perception of traditional classrooms in high schools to a \u2018student-centered\u2019 classroom in the university.

It also identifies the sources of resistance to change, approaches used to control them, and explores the role of internal and external communication in stakeholders\u2019 engagement and in the management of change initiatives.\r\nA case study approach was adopted, focusing on the King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Public Education Development Project (Tatweer), the most comprehensive reform initiative introduced in the Saudi educational system to date. Data collection occurred via semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and reviewing documentary evidence. The research used snowball and maximum variation sampling to interview key informants from officials from the Ministry of Education, as well as teachers and head teachers at Tatweer pilot schools and private schools, to provide in-depth insights into the context of change and to explore the factors limiting implementation.\r\nThe software package Nvivo10 was utilised to aid analysis. This commenced by coding to explore and compare perspectives. Matrices were developed for comparative pattern analysis at the Ministry of Education and school levels. Private schools do not perceive public schools as competitors and competition is not visible between public schools.\r\nThe analysis of the management of the project revealed several problems surrounding the project\u2019s implementation, particularly insufficient communication, lack of incentives, limited training, and improper resource allocation. Resistance to change emerged due to insufficient communication and incentives. The culture and social norms of Saudi society interfere with effective organisational management.\r\nInternal and external communication plays a crucial role in change initiatives and minimising resistance to change. However, in the Saudi public educational system, external communication is limited and tends to be viewed as superfluous, competition between schools does not exist, and external stakeholder participation is minimal. The findings revealed that parents\u2019 minimal involvement impeded the implementation of change initiatives. Schools seldom engage in strategies to enhance student recruitment and without providing incentives, schools are less interested in enrolling additional students, which reduces competition, and consequently external communication remains of marginal importance in Saudi Arabia", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Newcastle University", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/153779484.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/153779484.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/153779484", "http://hdl.handle.net/10443/2917"]}, {"authors": ["Motale, George Tanyi"], "title": "The impact of socio-economic status on learners' achievement at public schools in Nkangala District Mpumalanga Province", "description": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the socio-economic impact of learners\u2019 achievement at public schools in Nkangala District in the Mpumalanga Province.

This means that the robot, by using its cameras, can recognize geometric figures even with the competition for the attention of all the objects in the image in real time. The proposed method is validated through some tests with 13 to 14 year old kids interacting with the robot NAO that provides some tips (such as the perimeter and area calculation formulas) and recognizes the figure showed by these children.

The innovation of the technology and the gap of suitable candidates for open positions is the reason to research SNSs. The labour market is changing e.g. demographic changes is the reason to investigate new tools and channels to contact employees and to identify suitable candidates quickly and easily on the most economical basis.  Under these circumstances the human resources management (HRM) is assuming increasing importance. The recruiting process especially influences the competiveness and success of a company. SNSs can give access to potential candidates. The various stakeholders of SNSs have different objectives, interests and benefits with SNSs. The private SNSs and business SNSs have different purposes.  The operations of the mechanism in SNSs have been explained with social capital theory to provide recommendations to organisations. The research tests the theory to find out the usefulness of social capital theory to identify new mechanisms on SNSs and provide a framework to research SNSs and the employment seeking process.  Based on the literature review and theoretical framework qualitative interviews have been carried out. The results of the interviews define variables for the further empirical research and provide a deeper insight. The data of the quantitative survey with more than 900 participants has been analysed with different statistic tools.  The practical aim of the dissertation is to clarify the use of SNSs. The management needs information about SNSs that HRM can use SNSs as a management tool for the recruiting process and understands the mechanism and operations on SNSs which gives a strategic advantage to the organisation. The result of the dissertation is that SNSs have the potential to be used for the employment seeking process. The purpose of the SNS and objectives of the members influence the use and mechanism of SNS. The variable \u201dtrust\u201d, \u201cexchange\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d are key elements for the mechanism of SNSs. Privacy and trust is on a low level on SNSs and they are mainly used to exchange information. The correlation between the use of SNSs with the employment seeking process has weak correlation coefficients", "datePublished": "2016-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Latvijas Universit\u0101te", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/74513291.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74513291.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/74513291", "https://dspace.lu.lv/dspace/handle/7/34495"]}, {"authors": ["Henriksen, Michael", "Lindegaard, Fredrik"], "title": "LEDERKOMPETANSE ELLER FAGKOMPETANSE - Hva betyr utdanningsbakgrunn for personallederes utf\u00f8relse av HR-aktiviteter i norske IT-bedrifter?", "description": "I denne oppgaven ville vi bidra til \u00e5 sette lys p\u00e5 utdanningens betydning for ut\u00f8velse av HR hos personalledere i IT-bransjen.

When students learn to read, they should be able to comprehend the text during reading process. Reading difficulties become most apparent when the students are unable to grasp the meaning from a text. They find it hard to get main idea, supporting details, and even deciding the schematic structure of the text. This is because the students do not know specific technique that can guide them to understanding the text and predicting the meaning. As the effort to improve students\u2019 reading comprehension, teacher should be more creative and make learning process more interesting and more favored by learners. Therefore, the writer conducts a study about \u201cTeaching Reading comprehension of Narrative Text by Using Mind Mapping Technique\u201d. The purposes of this study are to find out the effectiveness of mind mapping technique toward students\u2019 reading comprehension and to know the obstacle in applying mind mapping technique. This research was a pre experimental research which used one class as an experimental class. The sample of this study was class VIII-b of SMP Inshafuddin Banda Aceh. The techniques used in obtaining the data were test (pre-test and post-test) and questionnaire. The mean scores of the students in pre-test was 50, while in post-test the score increased to 72. It can be concluded that mind mapping technique was effective to improve students\u2019 reading comprehension. Then, based on the analysis of questionnaires, most of students gave positive responses on using mind mapping technique while there are some of them who gave negative responses. However there are some of them who still find it difficult to apply mind mapping, but some others find it easy and enjoy applying the technique. By applying mind mapping technique they became more creative.Finally, the writer concludes that mind mapping technique is one of the techniques that can be used in order to improve students\u2019 reading comprehension", "datePublished": "2016-09-09T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/293465507.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/293465507.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/293465507", "https://repository.ar-raniry.ac.id/id/eprint/2271/1/Fadhilah%20Andrini.pdf", "https://repository.ar-raniry.ac.id/id/eprint/2271/"]}, {"authors": ["Zainal Abidin, Siti Aisyah"], "title": "Remote Watering System for Home Garden", "description": "This project is conducted to develop a part of a home automation system which is a remote watering system that enables the user to monitor their home garden during their absence.

Many research efforts have been focused on fault diagnosis and detection of roller bearings, since they constitute one the most important elements of rotating machinery. In this study a combination method is proposed for early damage detection of roller bearing. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is applied to the collected data for denoising and the resulting clean data are break-down into some elementary components called Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The normalized energy of three first IMFs are used as input for Support vector machine (SVM) to recognize whether signals are sorting out from healthy or faulty bearings. Then, since there is no robust guide to determine amplitude of added noise in EEMD technique, a new Performance improved EEMD (PIEEMD) is proposed to determine the appropriate value of added noise. A novel feature extraction method is also proposed for detecting small size defect using Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). TKEO is applied to IMFs obtained to create new feature vectors as input data for one-class SVM. The results of applying the method to acceleration signals collected from an experimental bearing test rig demonstrated that the method can be successfully used for early damage detection of roller bearings. Most of the diagnostic methods that have been developed up to now can be applied for the case stationary working conditions only (constant speed and load). However, bearings often work at time-varying conditions such as wind turbine supporting bearings, mining excavator bearings, vehicles, robots and all processes with run-up and run-down transients. Damage identification for bearings working under non-stationary operating conditions, especially for early/small defects, requires the use of appropriate techniques, which are generally different from those used for the case of stationary conditions, in order to extract fault-sensitive features which are at the same time insensitive to operational condition variations. Some methods have been proposed for damage detection of bearings working under time-varying speed conditions. However, their application might increase the instrumentation cost because of providing a phase reference signal. Furthermore, some methods such as order tracking methods still can be applied when the speed variation is limited. In this study, a novel combined method based on cointegration is proposed for the development of fault features which are sensitive to the presence of defects while in the same time they are insensitive to changes in the operational conditions. It does not require any additional measurements and can identify defects even for considerable speed variations. The signals acquired during run-up condition are decomposed into IMFs using the performance improved EEMD method. Then, the cointegration method is applied to the intrinsic mode functions to extract stationary residuals. The feature vectors are created by applying the Teager-Kaiser energy operator to the obtained stationary residuals. Finally, the feature vectors of the healthy bearing signals are utilized to construct a separating hyperplane using one-class support vector machine. Eventually the proposed method was applied to vibration signals measured on an experimental bearing test rig. The results verified that the method can successfully distinguish between healthy and faulty bearings even if the shaft speed changes dramaticall", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "doi": "10.6092/polito", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76526156.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76526156.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/76526156", "http://porto.polito.it/2598388/", "http://porto.polito.it/2598388/1/thesis_Tabrizi.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Esther M.

Conveying human emotion in a digital human-like character is widely accepted to be the most challenging and elusive task for even the most skilled animators. Contemporary filmmakers have increasingly looked to complex digital tools that essentially manipulate the visual design of cinema through innovative techniques to reach levels of undetectable integration of CG characters.\r\nIn trying to assess how modern cinema is pursuing the realistic integration of CG human-like characters in digital film with frenetic interest despite the risk of box office failure associated with the uncanny valley, this report focuses on the progress of the advances in the technique of facial motion capture. The uncanny valley hypothesis, based on a theory by Sigmund Freud, was coined in 1970 by Japanese robotics professor, Masahiro Mori. Mori suggested that people are increasingly comfortable with robots the more human-like they appear, but only up to a point. At that turning point, when the robot becomes too human-like,\r\nit arouses feelings of repulsion. When movement is added to this equation, viewers\u2019 sense of the uncanny is heightened when the movement is deemed to be unreal.\r\nMotion capture is the technique of mimicking and capturing realistic movement by utilising technology that enables the process of translating a live actor\u2019s performance into a digital performance. By capturing and transferring the data collected from sensors placed on a body suit or tracked from a high definition video, computer artists are able to drive the movement of a corresponding CG character in a 3-Dimensional (3D) programme. The attention of this study is narrowed to the progress of the techniques developed during a prolific decade for facial motion capture in particular. Regardless of the conflicting discourse surrounding the use of motion capture technology, these phenomenal improvements have allowed filmmakers to overcome that aspect of the uncanny valley associated with detecting realistic movement and facial expression. The progress of facial motion capture is investigated through the lens of selected films released during the period of 2001 to 2012. The two case studies, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Avatar (2009) were chosen for their individual achievement and innovative techniques that introduced new methods of facial capture.\r\nDigital images are said to undermine the reality status of cinematic images by challenging the foundation of long held theories of cinematic realist theory. These theories rooted in the indexical basis of photography, have proved to be the origin of contemporary viewers' notion of cinematic realism. However, the relationship between advanced digital effects and modern cinematic realism has created a perceptual complexity that warrants closer scrutiny. In addressing the paradoxical effect that photo-real cinematic realism is having on the basic comprehension of realism in film, the history of the seminal claims made by recognized realist film theorists is briefly examined", "datePublished": "2014-10-22T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/39674440.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/39674440.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/39674440", "http://hdl.handle.net/10539/15791"]}, {"authors": ["Garland, Christopher M"], "title": "Gamification and Implications for Second Language Education: A Meta Analysis", "description": "Gamification is a fairly new concept that involves using game elements in non-game contexts.

If the domain Ontology is annotated with the Recommender Ontology, the Semantic Recommender should be able to generate recommendations. As a result, the proposed system works with any domain data. Thanks to The Semantic Web standards.\r\nThe proposed mathematical model takes into consideration, in addition to items\u2019 features and users\u2019 profiles, the context of the users and the temporal context, so some items, as an event\u2019s ticket, should never be recommended if the event is over, and should get more presence before the event.\r\nThe Recommender Ontology grants business owners a way to boost the recommended items according to their needs. This guarantees more diversity, which satisfies the business requirements.\r\nFor the experiments, we have tested the proposed solution with many domains including movies, books, music, and with a real business company.

We conducted cohort analyses including 367 participants (10yr at baseline, 14yr at follow-up) with valid data for objectively-measured activity (Actigraph), DED (4-day food diary), anthropometry (waist circumference (WC), %body fat (%BF), fat mass index (FMI), weight status), and covariates. Linear and logistic regression models were fit, including adjustment for DED and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Results showed that baseline DED was associated with change in WC (\u03b2 for 1kJ/g difference: 0.71; 0.26:1.17), particularly in boys (1.26; 0.41:2.16 vs. girls: 0.26: -0.34;0.87), but not with %BF, FMI or weight status.

Change in SED, MPA and VPA did not predict adiposity at follow-up. In conclusion, activity intensity was not prospectively associated with adiposity, whereas the directions of associations with DED were inconsistent.

Ramallah untersucht die r\u00e4umlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen und zugeh\u00f6rigen Vorstellungen von Stadt(raum) am Beispiel Ramallah \u2013 vom Niedergang des Osmanischen Reichs, \u00fcber das letzte Jahrhundert Anglo- Zionistischer Kolonisierung, bis heute \u2013 und sondiert m\u00f6gliche zuk\u00fcnftige Entwicklungen und Ideen. Die Evolution des spezifischen Raumgef\u00fcges Ramallahs stellt sich dar als Resultat von unterschiedlichen aber dennoch cyclischen Spannungen zwischen hegemonialer Kontrolle einerseits und gegenl\u00e4ufiger Widerstandsbewegungen andererseits. Basierend auf der eingehenden Untersuchung der Gegebenheiten und der Triangulation von morphologischen und territorialen Ver\u00e4nderungen mit sozio-demographischen und wirtschaftspolitischen Faktoren postuliert diese Arbeit drei Hypothesen:\r\n[1] Ramallahs Stadtraum ist das Produkt eines artikulierten kolonialen Projektes, dessen Diskurs enge, homogene Vorstellungen von Ethnie und nationaler Identit\u00e4t propagiert, und sterile, \u00fcberwachte und gesicherte R\u00e4ume hervorgebracht hat. Gleichzeitig beeinflussen heute neoliberale Diskurse die Entwicklung und verstehen die Zielbev\u00f6lkerung weiterhin eher als passiven Empf\u00e4nger, denn als m\u00fcndiger Akteur in der Stadtproduktion. Alternative Vorstellungen von Stadt werden oft als Anomalit\u00e4ten abgelehnt, bek\u00e4mpft und in den seltensten F\u00e4llen umgesetzt. Das Ergebnis war und ist die (absichtliche?) Schaffung eines mutierten Systems mit einer \u00fcber-b\u00fcrokratischen, schlecht angepassten Verwaltung, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig vers\u00e4umt, Grundlagen zum Erf\u00fcllen sozio\u00f6konomischer Bed\u00fcrfnisse bereitzustellen, und dadurch langfristig Entwicklung und Stabilit\u00e4t zu schaffen. \r\n[2] Die Dialektik des marxistischen Diskurses versteht Stadtraumproduktion als nat\u00fcrlichen (psycho-) \u00f6kologischen Prozess. Aus dieser Perspektive k\u00f6nnen die Post-Oslo-Kontroverse und Frustration in Ramallah auf die Verbitterung angesichts des sozialen \u201eAnderssein\u201c \u2013 \u00fcber normale gro\u00dfst\u00e4dtische Symptome hinaus \u2013 aufgrund des akuten Anstiegs an Unsicherheit (abnehmende Sicherheit), Ungleichheit und r\u00e4umliche Unw\u00fcrde zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden. Die Kartierung von Verhaltenstendenzen und Bewegungen welche die Wiederherstellung von sumud (soziale Resilienz) zum Ziel haben l\u00e4sst den Schluss zu, dass sich Spannungen \u2013 in Form von verschiedenartiger (meist spontaner) B\u00fcrgermobilisierung \u2013 zwangsl\u00e4ufig entladen werden. Identifizierte Faktoren und wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen deuten auf eine erh\u00f6hte M\u00f6glichkeit von Gewalt hin; ob aufgrund des hohen Grades an Militarisierung und kontroll-fanatischen Nationalstaats-Diskurs, oder der eher generellen (aber untersch\u00e4tzten) Verwundbarkeit gegen\u00fcber (Natur-) Katastrophen. Der Grad und die Auswirkung von Aktivit\u00e4ten von subversiven und klandestinen Sub-Gruppen wiederum h\u00e4ngt von mehreren Faktoren ab; ein entscheidender ist die Art und Weise, in der Stadtraum in den kommenden Jahrzehnten gedacht und produziert werden wird. \r\n[3] St\u00e4dtebau, Stadtplanung und -management werden oft als Tr\u00e4ger von Wohlergehen gesehen und gelten weniger als Katalysator von mentalen und corporealen Krisen. Die zugeh\u00f6rigen Berufsfelder kapitalisieren und katalysieren politische Ideologien, welche antikonformistische Vision\u00e4re einbeziehen/ausschlie\u00dfen in/aus formelle Prozesse der (sozial)r\u00e4umlichen Produktion. Ramallah ist hier keine Ausnahme der neokolonialen Regel: Stadtplaner weisen die Schuld am un-egalit\u00e4ren Urbanismus von sich und verweisen auf ethnischen Unterjochung und Instabilit\u00e4t hin; schaffen es jedoch nicht konstruktive, anwendbare Alternativen zu erarbeiten die m\u00f6gliche Unsicherheiten ber\u00fccksichtigen. In einer Stadt wie Ramallah, wo subjektive Zeitlichkeit st\u00e4ndig neue Risikostrategien und Bev\u00f6lkerungsstr\u00f6me hervorbringt, sind statische Rahmen f\u00fcr indizierte Mechanismen und Hierarchien \u00fcberholt. In Kombination mit den heutigen, digital erm\u00f6glichten, pseudo-konkreten Realit\u00e4ten und dem erh\u00f6hten Grad an Privatisierung, erfordert Ramallahs Resilienz dass die Produktion von R\u00e4umen demokratisiert wird und somit, auf Basis von B\u00fcrgerrechten, R\u00e4ume entkolonialisiert werden. Die zuk\u00fcnftige Form und der Grad der Resilienz / sumud h\u00e4ngen von der F\u00e4higkeit der Bev\u00f6lkerung ab, ihre W\u00fcnsche, Vielfalt, Fluidit\u00e4t und inter-Relevanz zu verr\u00e4umlichen (zu legitimieren). Zu diesem Zweck ist ein Umdenkprozess \u00fcber die Rolle der Bev\u00f6lkerung \u2013 als multipler Akteur und urbanem Vision\u00e4r \u2013 und m\u00f6glicher Interventionsbereiche von Ramallahs wesentlich.\r\nDie Arbeit ist aufgeteilt in sechs Kapitel, beginnend mit den Rahmenbedingungen, r\u00e4umlichem und zeitlichem Hintergrund, und der Erl\u00e4uterung der Hypothesen. Das zweite Kapitel ist darauf fokussiert, die r\u00e4umliche Evolution der Stadt durch Vergleich mit politischen und sozio\u00f6konomischen Elementen nachzuverfolgen und zu verstehen, wobei philosophisch zwischen projizierten (vorgestellten, mentalen) und fundierten (wissenschaftlichen, realen) Bedeutungen, Ideologien, und ihren wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und insbesondere r\u00e4umlichen Spuren und Implikationen differenziert wird. Kapitel drei legt die politisch-\u00f6konomischen Faktoren dar, die Ramallahs r\u00e4umliche Tendenzen in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten seit der Unterschrift des Osloer Abkommen von 1993 antreiben. Gleichzeitig untersucht die Arbeit die r\u00e4umlich-sozialen Beziehungen und Empfindlichkeiten die diese Diskurse legitimieren und ausreifen lassen. Kapitel vier und f\u00fcnf setzen damit fort, urbane Vorhaben sowohl von privaten als auch von \u00f6ffentlichen Beteiligten zu kartieren; in ihnen enthalten sind die Mandate und Einfl\u00fcsse auf Macht und Entscheidungsfindung; Betriebsmodi, Strukturen und systematische Variablen; die relevantesten Projekte und Engagements; theoretische Genealogien und Vergleichsf\u00e4lle; vorhergesehene r\u00e4umlich-soziale Konsequenzen und die zu Grunde liegenden Chancen. Kapitel sechs schlie\u00dft diese Arbeit, in dem es die Erkenntnisse der vorangegangen Kapitel in variable Vorstellungen von alternativen urbanen Realit\u00e4ten zusammensetzt, die Ramallah potentiell hervorbringen k\u00f6nnte. Durch eine Neuverhandlung der bestehenden kolonialen Morphologie und des zentralisierten, b\u00fcrokratischen Enscheidungssystems, untersucht dieses Kapitel M\u00f6glichkeiten, \u00f6kologisch, wirtschaftlich und politisch resiliente, integrative und fortschrittliche R\u00e4ume f\u00fcr Widerstand und sozialr\u00e4umliche De-Kolonialisierung zu n\u00e4hren. Zum gegenw\u00e4rtigen, kritischen Zeitpunkt \u2013 insbesondere f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4stina, und allgemein f\u00fcr St\u00e4dte mit antikolonialen Revolutionen \u2013 sind Modi der Raumabsorption, Skalierung, Synthese, und Neuvorstellungen von standortspezifischen sozialen Ideologien und Bewegungen essentiell f\u00fcr Lebensqualit\u00e4t und W\u00fcrde. \r\nDie Argumente in dieser Arbeit basieren auf einer Literaturrecherche mit einer Vielzahl von Werken aus verschiedenen Disziplinen, akademische und sonstige. Diese wurden mit empirischen Daten, die in zwanzig qualitativen Interviews, acht Fokusgruppen, Beobachtungen und quantitativen Indikatoren \u2013 welche in acht Feldbesuchen mit einer Gesamtzeit von 32 Wochen und mit durchschnittlich sechs Monaten Abstand gesammelt wurden \u2013 kreuzanalysiert. \r\nNeben der wissenschaftlichen Motivation dieser Arbeit soll diese auch als wissenschaftliches Narrativ dienen, das einige Facetten der aktuellen Polemiken, ge\u00e4u\u00dferten Bestrebungen und intellektuellen Brainstormings \u00fcber Ramallah zusammenf\u00fchrt. Dieser f\u00fcnf Jahre andauernde Prozess hat eine Vielzahl an provozierenden und inspirierenden Unterhaltungen, Debatten, und Versammlungen durchlaufen, und zielt hiermit darauf ab, Konzepte eines aufr\u00fchrerischen Urbanismus darzulegen. \r\nDie hier skizzierten \u00dcberlegungen beanspruchen nicht, unterschiedliche Verst\u00e4ndnisweisen und Interpretationen zu verhindern oder zu limitieren, sondern sollen Aufmerksamkeit auf eine Auswahl an polychromen Aspekten lenken, die einer tieferen Untersuchung bed\u00fcrfen.100 x Ramallah is an investigation of spatial (re-)imagineering of the city of Ramallah, Palestine since the demise of the Osmans and over the past century of Anglo-Zionist colonisation, and an exploration of what could follow. The line of evolution of successive Ramallite spacio-sensibilities transcribes the tensions of nonuniform yet cyclical tides of centralised hegemonic control and counter-resistance. By triangulating morphological and territorial shifts with socio-demographics and politico-economic orders this work argues through three hypotheses. \r\nFirst, Ramallah\u2019s city-space is a product of an articulate colonial project whose discourse promotes narrow homogenised imaginaries of ethnicities and national identities, and therewith sterilised, surveilled and securitized spaces. These concepts have been inducing variations of both, co-optation and opposition. In the same line, neoliberal development discourses continue to infantalize target populations as passive recipients. Hence, these are decisively myopic to the fact that the latter are capable of engendering alternative imaginations, and in cases where these materialise into realities they are rejected and combated as anomalies. The result has been the (intentional?) creation of a mutated system of bureaucratic, incompatible administration that repeatedly fails to provide for basic socioeconomic needs, therewith shared development and stability. In effect, what has been unfolding in Palestine is de-development.\r\nSecond, the dialectic Marxist discourse contends urbanities as natural decodings of psycho-ecological processes. Understood from this perspective, the post-Oslo contestation and frustration in the city can be traced to the exasperation of social otherness beyond regular metropolitan symptoms, due to the acute increase in scales of uncertainty (diminishing securities), inequality and spatial non-dignity. Through mapping the behavioural trend of re-making of sumud (social resilience) it can be concluded that tensions are bound to be released through (mostly ad hoc) techniques and formations of citizen mobilisations. Identified factors and scholarship indicate an elevated possibility of violence; whether due to high levels of militarisation by the nation-state policing discourses or its vulnerability to natural misfortunes. The scales and impacts of clandestine sub-group activities in turn depends on several factors, one of which is the manner by which the city-space will be produced in the coming, critical decades. \r\nThird, urban design, planning, and management are tools often advocated as bearers of welfare and rarely admitted as enablers of mental as well as corporeal crisis. These are professions that by nature capitalise on and catalyse political ideologies which include/exclude anticonformist visionaries in/from formal processes of socio-spatial production. Here Ramallah presents no exception to the neocolonial rule, where its planners (rightfully) blame the failure in forging egalitarian urbanism on racial subjugation and instability, yet fall short of constructively labouring applicable alternatives that account for uncertainty. In cities like Ramallah where subjective temporalities constantly produce new risk-strategies and population flows, static frameworks of indexed mechanisms and hierarchies are rendered obsolete. In combination with today\u2019s digitally-enabled pseudo-concrete realities and heightened levels of privatization; Ramallah\u2019s resilience necessitates that it democratizes spatial production and therewith decolonize its spaces based on concepts of the civic right to flourishing. The future shape and degree of resilience/sumud depend on the ability of the (self-declared) Ramallites to spatialize (grant legitimacy to) their diversity, fluidity, and inter-relevance. To that end, an Umdenkenprozess about the role and range of fields of interventions of Ramallite urban visionaries is quintessential.\r\nThe outline of this work spreads over six chapters, starting with setting the parameters, territorial and temporal back-drop, and elaborates on the hypotheses. The second chapter focuses on tracing and understanding the spatial evolution of the city through cross-comparing those to political and socioeconomic elements; hence philosophically differentiating between projected (imagined, mental) and grounded (scientific, real) meanings, ideologies, and their economic, social and particularly spatial trails and implications. Chapter three expounds on the politico-economic factors fuelling Ramallah\u2019s spatial tendencies in the past two decades since the signature of the Oslo Accords in 1993. It simultaneously investigates the spacio-social relationalities and sensibilities legitimising and incubating these discourses. Chapters four and five proceed to map urban undertakings by both public and private parties (respectively); they feature the power and decision-making mandates and influence; modes of operation, structures and systematic variables; the most relevant projects and engagements; theoretical genealogies and comparative cases; foreseen sociospatial consequences, and; the underlying opportunities. Chapter 6 concludes this work with puzzling the findings of former chapters in variable imaginations of alternative urban realities that Ramallah could potentially produce. Through re-negotiating the existing colonial morphology and centralized, bureaucratic decision-making systems, this chapter explores opportunities for nurturing environmentally, economically and politically resilient, inclusive and progressive spaces of resistance and sociospatial decolonization. In the current critical moment for Palestine specifically and cities featuring anti-colonial revolutions generally; modes of spatial absorption, scaling, synthesis, and reimagineering of locational social ideologies and movements is essential for the quality of life and dignity.\r\nAlong the process arguments are based on scholarly review of a wide range of works from varying disciplines, both academic and otherwise. These were cross-analysed with empirical data collected through twenty qualitative interviews, eight focus groups, observations and quantitative indicators; collected through eight field-visits totalling thirty-two weeks and spanning over intervals of six months in average. \r\nAside the scientific motivations of this work, it desires to serve as a scholarly narrative that coalesces some facets of the momentary polemics, voiced aspirations and intellectual brainstorming about Ramallah. This five-year process has travelled through multitude of provocative and inspiring conversations, debates, and assemblies, and herewith aims at expounding on concepts of insurgent urbanism. The reflections outlined here do not claim premise to foreclosing or limiting differing understandings and interpretations; rather it calls attention to a selection of polychromic aspects requiring deeper investigation", "datePublished": "2016-01-21T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Wissenschaftliche Abschlussarbeiten \u00bb Dissertation", "Text"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/33797046.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/33797046.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/33797046", "https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de:443/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-40599/Diss_Aruri.pdf", "https://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de:443/servlets/DocumentServlet?id=40180"]}, {"authors": ["Akawa, Ester Anna Nelago"], "title": "Teachers' perceptions of behavioural problems manifested by Grade 11 and 12 learners in three Namibian schools", "description": "In Namibia today few learners with behavioural and learning problems are within special schools as most are placed within the mainstream school system. Placing these learners within the mainstream system is part of the policy of Inclusive Education (IE) because it argues that this would benefit these learners and also save resources. IE is concerned with addressing barriers to learning and behavioural problems are regarded as one of these barriers. IE argues for a series of new approaches to the diagnosis and response to learners with behavioural problems. This poses challenges for teachers in mainstream schools. Teachers are at the forefront of this situation as they are usually the first to observe and experience the behavioural problems in the schools and are expected to respond appropriately. They find this situation both challenging and problematic. This research explores a sample of teachers\u2019 perceptions of learners\u2019 behavioural problems. To collect in-depth information, this study followed a qualitative approach with a case study design. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, supplemented with observation and document analysis. The study consisted of fifteen respondents: three principals, three teacher counsellors and nine teachers from the three selected schools. This study illuminates the types of behaviour that teachers encounter, the impact of these behaviours, the factors seen as contributing to these behaviours, and how teachers and the school system deal with these behaviours. In addition the study applies Bronfenbrenner\u2019s bioecological model (1992) to explain how the behaviours manifested by Grade 11 and 12 learners, and identified as problematic by teachers, are part of an interconnected nested social system. The results from the study indicate the manifestation of behavioural problems to be common occurrences in secondary schools are evident, amongst others, through fighting, bullying, substance abuse, truancy, and disrespect of teachers and authority. The teachers pointed to the prevalence of these problems as well as the serious impact such problems have on these learners, their fellow learners, and on the teachers. The teachers identified a complex array of what they saw as contributing factors located within the school, peer groups, family and home circumstances, the local community, as well within the national education policy, the economy and society.

Since it gained its independence in 1990, the government positioned education at the top of the national priorities. Thus, there has been a growing realisation of the importance of more democratic forms of leadership in the education system for the country to be able to cater for a democratic society. Amongst others, teachers became active creators and managers of the learning outcomes. In addition, teachers are regarded as agents of change and the driving force for productive teaching and learning. Literature describes how the management in schools has been redistributing authority and power so that a culture of teacher leadership in school communities can grow. More importantly, school improvement depends more on the active involvement of teacher leaders as it is realised that people in formal positions cannot do everything. In this line this study investigated the understanding of teachers and members of management of teacher leadership practice and it further identified the structural and cultural factors which enabled and inhibited this practice in a primary school. This study is a case study of a Primary school in a semi-urban area of Otjozondjupa Region, a central part of Namibia. This study was conducted in the interpretive paradigm and it is a qualitative case in nature, employing semi-structured interviews, observation and document analysis. Triangulation over the data revealed that respondents have an understanding of the concept and that all teachers are involved in leadership roles at school which are more strongly found in the classroom and through involvement with other teachers. Teacher leadership roles at the case study school also occur within the whole school with some limitations and also extend beyond the school. Grant\u2019s (2008) model of teacher leadership was used to analyse the data. The study suggested some hindrances and supporting factors of teacher leadership. The findings suggested that teacher leadership is understood at the case study school and that they experienced factors that enabled and hindered this practice at different stages. Enabling factors included the school structure, further studies and workshops attended, while teacher leadership is impeded by teachers\u2019 unwillingness to collaborate with others and the platoon system.

Professor Vasant Dhar, Editor-In-Chief of Big Data (Professor at NYU) define data science as a generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. The core concept of semantic based search engine project developed by my team is to extract a high frequency finite sequence of keywords by association mining. Each frequent finite keywords sequences represent a human concept in a document set. The collective view of such a collection concepts represent a piece of human knowledge. So this MS project is a data science project. By regarding each keyword as an abstract vertex, a finite sequence of keywords becomes a simplex, and the collection becomes a simplicial complexes. Based on this geometric view, new type of clustering can be performed here. If two concepts are connected by n-simplex, we say that these two simplex are connected. Those connected components will be captured by Homology Theory of Simplicial Complexes. The input data for this project are ten thousand files about data mining which are downloaded from IEEE explore library. The search engine nowadays deals with large amount of high dimensional data. Applying mathematical concepts and measuring the connectivity for ten thousand files will be a real challenge. Since, using algebraic topology is a complete new approach.

Candida albicans is the etiological agent in over 80% of vaginal candidiasis cases. Attributes of both C. albicans and the host contribute to development of vaginal candidiasis. The studies presented in this dissertation used two different experimental approaches to assess the effect of the host vaginal environment on the cellular and molecular biology of C. albicans. The first approach evaluated the expression of the eight agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) genes in clinical vaginal specimens and in models of vaginal candidiasis, including a murine model and an in vitro tissue model. The ALS genes encode large cell-surface glycoproteins that are candidates for aiding C. albicans colonization of the vaginal epithelium and/or for promoting development of vaginal disease. Vaginal-specific patterns of ALS gene expression were detected using reverse transcription-PCR and suggested that ALS gene expression is specific to the host site where  C. albicans cells are located. The second experimental approach was prompted by reports in the scientific literature that suggested a positive association between elevated estrogen concentration and the incidence of vaginal candidiasis. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of estrogen on the growth characteristics and transcriptional profile of C. albicans  cultured in defined media. Addition of estrogen to C. albicans  cells resulted in increased germ tube formation and length in an estrogen-, dose- and strain-dependent manner, but did not have a significant effect on culture biomass. Genes that were differentially expressed in the presence of estrogen were defined by microarray analysis and included  CDR1 and CDR2. Analysis of estrogen-exposed strain DSY654, that lacks CDR1 and CDR2 coding sequences, showed a significantly decreased number of germ tube-forming cells in the presence of estrogen. PDR16 was the most highly up-regulated gene in strain DSY654 under the growth conditions assayed. The cell biology and gene expression data led to a model to explain how components of the phospholipid and sterol metabolic pathways may interact to affect C. albicans germ tube formation and length. Collectively these two different experimental approaches produced new insight into the interaction between C. albicans  and the vaginal environment.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158310674", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/87629"]}, {"authors": ["Toth, Amy Lynn"], "title": "Comparative Physiological and Genomic Analyses of Division of Labor in Honey Bees and Paper Wasps", "description": "139 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.This thesis describes research aimed at understanding the mechanisms and evolution of sociality in colony-forming insects. I first summarize a conceptual framework for the study of social behavior inspired by the field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\"); I suggest complex social behavior evolves via co-option of mechanisms underlying basic forms of solitary behavior, such as feeding and reproduction. Next, I describe research with honey bees (Apis mellifera) to determine whether division of labor between workers is related to individual nutritional status. I found that bees performing foraging behavior have half the abdominal lipid stores of hive-workers. Then, I demonstrated experimental lipid depletion causes early onset of foraging, suggesting that a change in nutritional status can have a causal influence on behavior. Additionally, my results show that social interactions between workers are necessary for bees to attain high lipid stores as found in hive-workers, but that social interactions and nutrition act independently to influence foraging ontogeny. Because a nutritionally-depleted foraging force characterizes many social insect species, I investigated whether the nutritional mechanism and other molecular pathways influencing division of labor are conserved in an insect with independently evolved sociality, the paper wasp Polistes metricus. I also found low abdominal lipid in P. metricus foragers. I then developed an EST project of sequences representing approximately 5000 P. metricus genes. I examined the expression of a set of 32 P. metricus orthologs to genes known from previous studies to be associated with foraging behavior in worker honey bees. I found that expression of this set of genes differed significantly between P. metricus females in distinct behavioral castes. Expression patterns of individual wasps were predictive of behavioral state with a high (up to 80%) rate of success. In addition, I found 34% of genes to be associated with differences in wasp foraging state. In summary, I have demonstrated shared patterns of physiological and molecular regulation of social organization in two species with widely different forms of sociality. These results suggest several shared mechanisms underlying multiple origins of sociality and hint at the existence of a shared genetic \"toolkit\" for the evolution of social organization.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158308414", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/85368"]}, {"authors": ["Tooker, John Frazier"], "title": "Multitrophic Interactions in a Prairie Insect Community: Ecology, Behavior, and Conservation", "description": "138 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2003.Tallgrass prairies used to dominate the midwestern United States, but have been reduced to <0.01% of their original pre-settlement area. The plant communities of this ecosystem are relatively well known and appreciated, but little is known of the biology of most insects that are endemic to prairie ecosystems of North America, with the exception of large and conspicuous species. In particular, species that are sequestered within plant tissues are commonly overlooked. With my research, I characterized the community of insect species that inhabit flowering stems of Silphium laciniatum L. and  S. terebinthinaceum Jacquin. I used stable isotope analysis to clarify the trophic position of several of the key members of the community, determining that the only beetle in the system is a facultative predator. Prairies are commonly managed using prescribed burns and endophytic insects seem quite vulnerable to burning because they occupy the herb or \"fuel\" layer of prairies, so I evaluated the impact of fire this insect community. I found fires decimate populations of these insects, but they recover quickly after the burn. I also studied host plant recognition by males and females of the gall wasp Antistrophus rufus Gillette whose larvae fed in  S. laciniatum and S. terebinthinaceum. I used olfactometry bioassays in the field and lab and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify the chemical cues they use to identify their natal host plant species. I used allozymes to determine that sub-populations of A. rufus are specialized and reproductively isolated on their host plant species and then described the Antistrophus rufus species complex, providing descriptions and morphological diagnoses for A. rufus, and new species A. meganae Tooker and Hanks, and A. jeanae  Tooker and Hanks, which are associated with S. terebinthinaceum  and S. perfoliatum L., respectively. Lastly, I evaluated the impact of gall wasps and parasitoids on the reproductive output of their host plants, determining that parasitoids can mediate the impact of gall wasps and providing new evidence from a co-evolved, native system that parasitoids can influence plant fitness, perhaps selecting for plant characters that encourage natural enemy attack.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158309489", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/86444"]}, {"authors": ["Hasan, Aamir"], "title": "Meta-path analysis for community detection in heterogeneous graphs with bound truth labels", "description": "Community Detection in heterogeneous graphs has important applications\r\nin various  fields such as sociology, biology and computer science.

Recently, a new fluorescence technique called fluorescence imaging with one nanometer accuracy (FIONA) was shown to localize the position of a fluorescent molecule within a nanometer. Using FIONA, we examined photophysical properties of ReAsH - a novel fluorescent molecule. We showed that ReAsH is more photostable and brighter than eGFP, indicating that ReAsH can be used for in vivo tracking and localization of specific proteins. We also have used FIONA to study myosin VI, the only myosin to move in a direction opposite that of other myosins. This reverse directionality enables myosin VI to be involved in endocytosis. We investigated its structural and functional mechanisms. First, we discovered the stepping mechanism of myosin VI. By placing fluorescent molecules in two different positions and using FIONA, we showed that myosin VI walks hand-over-hand. Second, we revealed the dimerization mechanism of myosin VI. We demonstrated that myosin VI can be dimerized by clustering monomers through binding them either to actin or to antibodies, which implies that cargo-binding induces the dimerization of myosin VI inside cells. Third, we showed that the 53 amino acids unique to myosin VI (the unique insert) determine its directionality. We constructed several chimeric myosins with or without the unique insert, and tested them with gliding assay, which showed that the unique insert causes reverse directionality. Using FIONA, we found that it has a broad distribution similar to that of myosin VI, suggesting that the converter domain is the source of its highly variable step size. Fourth, we measured the processivity of myosin VI at different temperatures, and found that the average step size was smaller at higher temperatures, suggesting that the lever arm becomes less rigid at higher temperatures. Circular dichroism spectrum confirmed a structural change at &sim;30&deg;C. We found that additional ADP increases the run-length of myosin VI, implying that the preference of myosin VI for ADP and competition between ADP and ATP for catalytic sites prevents myosin VI from detaching from actin and allows it to walk long distances.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291775787", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/84250"]}, {"authors": ["Best, Aaron Addison"], "title": "Evolution of Transcription in Archaea and the Early-Diverging Eukaryote, Giardia Lamblia", "description": "169 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2001.Comparative analyses are at the core of modern biology, providing insight into the evolution of life and specific cellular systems. This thesis analyzes transcription systems in Archaea and Eucarya in an effort to understand the evolution of this fundamental cellular process. Projects span from analyses of the archaeal RNA polymerase to a unique genome survey of transcription components in an early-diverging eukaryote. It is apparent that the evolution of transcriptional machinery can be subdivided into the evolution of a core system and the evolution of a peripheral set of factors modulating the activity and specificity of the core. We see the core in the similarity of RNA polymerases and modes of initiation between Archaea and Eucarya; through protein-protein interaction studies, we demonstrated that the RNA polymerases from each domain adopt a similar architecture. We see the periphery in an analysis of the genome of Giardia lamblia, highlighting the divergence of transcription systems during the early evolution of Eucarya. During the survey, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) from Giardia lamblia was observed to be highly degenerate relative to all known TBPs. Comparative modeling of giardial TBP with eukaryotic TBP crystal structures reveals altered binding surfaces for interactions with DNA and transcription factors. A comparative analysis of post-transcriptional modification of RNA in the three domains of life illustrates the uniqueness of each domain. It is likely that Archaea do not modify RNA by post-transcriptional polyadenylation, a process adopted for disparate functions in both the bacterial and eukaryal domains.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291778169", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/86633"]}, {"authors": ["Siuti, Nertila"], "title": "From Technology to Chromatin Biology: Contemporary Mass Spectrometry of Histones and Chromatin Associated Proteins", "description": "132 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.We have also developed a top down-like approach (middle down) which analyzes large peptides to characterize PTM profiles on histone H3.

A sample of seventy-five institutions was drawn, and surveys were mailed to \"good\" instructors in six major subjects areas--biology, economics, foreign language, freshman writing, history, and mathematics. The response rate of the survey was 309/450 or 69.0% with each of the six subject areas recording response rates exceeding 60.0%. Questions on the survey were grouped into categories that related to the study's ten research questions: (1) class and instructor characteristics, (2) writing and related activities, (3) reasons for writing, (4) longer writing assignments, (5) intellectual uses of writing, (6) teaching techniques, (7) audiences for student writing, (8) responses to student writing, (9) length of writing assignments, (10) time allowed for writing assignments. The survey also included a section in which respondents answered questions and expressed their views on student writing.Overall, results indicated that writing occurs across subject areas in colleges, most frequently in the forms of note-taking, discursive writing of a paragraph or longer, and short-answer responses. College instructors stress application of subject area concepts and subject area information more than development of writing skills and personal experience. Informational uses of writing dominate student writing with personal and imaginative uses occurring infrequently. Prewriting, writing and revising, and postwriting techniques are used only sparingly in content classes. College instructors' responses are related to students' thinking processes, accuracy of conclusions, and organization. Subject area instructors accept joint responsibility with freshman writing instructors for teaching students to write, and they feel adequately prepared to do it. Most college instructors have not heard of the writing process movement, but most have heard of the writing across the curriculum movement.Additional conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made.

I first summarize a conceptual framework for the study of social behavior inspired by the field of evolutionary developmental biology (\"evo-devo\"); I suggest complex social behavior evolves via co-option of mechanisms underlying basic forms of solitary behavior, such as feeding and reproduction. Next, I describe research with honey bees (Apis mellifera) to determine whether division of labor between workers is related to individual nutritional status. I found that bees performing foraging behavior have half the abdominal lipid stores of hive-workers. Then, I demonstrated experimental lipid depletion causes early onset of foraging, suggesting that a change in nutritional status can have a causal influence on behavior. Additionally, my results show that social interactions between workers are necessary for bees to attain high lipid stores as found in hive-workers, but that social interactions and nutrition act independently to influence foraging ontogeny. Because a nutritionally-depleted foraging force characterizes many social insect species, I investigated whether the nutritional mechanism and other molecular pathways influencing division of labor are conserved in an insect with independently evolved sociality, the paper wasp Polistes metricus. I also found low abdominal lipid in P. metricus foragers. I then developed an EST project of sequences representing approximately 5000 P. metricus genes. I examined the expression of a set of 32 P. metricus orthologs to genes known from previous studies to be associated with foraging behavior in worker honey bees. I found that expression of this set of genes differed significantly between P. metricus females in distinct behavioral castes. Expression patterns of individual wasps were predictive of behavioral state with a high (up to 80%) rate of success. In addition, I found 34% of genes to be associated with differences in wasp foraging state. In summary, I have demonstrated shared patterns of physiological and molecular regulation of social organization in two species with widely different forms of sociality. These results suggest several shared mechanisms underlying multiple origins of sociality and hint at the existence of a shared genetic \"toolkit\" for the evolution of social organization.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291776905", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/85368"]}, {"authors": ["Canfield, Jeffrey M."], "title": "Approaching magnetic field effects in biology using the radical pair mechanism", "description": "The goal of my graduate work has been to try to understand or explain some of\r\nthe reported magnetic field effects in biology (see Chapter 1 for examples) using the\r\nradical pair mechanism, a quantum mechanical mechanism known for over 20 years\r\nthat lets the yields of certain radical pair reactions depend on the applied magnetic\r\nfield [1, 2, 3]. This goal seems reasonable considering the known roles of many biological\r\nfree radicals in cancer, disease, aging, development, and cellular signaling,\r\nthe constant reminders in the media to take anti-oxidant vitamins to protect against\r\ndangerous free radicals, and the success of the radical pair mechanism in explaining\r\nmagnetic field effects in photosynthetic reaction centers. The radical pair mechanism\r\n(as detailed in Chapter 2) occurs when a pair of radicals forms a cage radical pair,\r\na system composed of two unpaired electron spins whose spin motion is affected by\r\nnearby nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction, by applied magnetic fields via the\r\nZeeman effect, and by each other via the exchange and dipole interactions. The spin\r\nmotion varies in singlet/triplet character, and if the chemical reaction is more (or less)\r\nfavorable in a singlet/triplet state, the reaction rate can depend on applied magnetic\r\nfields, even ones very weak and near earth-strength.\r\nTo approach the above goal, during my graduate work I have developed and published\r\nseveral new perturbation treatments for combinations of steady and oscillating\r\nmagnetic fields in the radical pair mechanism: one based on the Schri::idinger Equation\r\n(see [4, 5] or Chapter 3), another based on the Liouville Equation (see [6] or\r\nChapter 4), and two more mixed perturbation methods that bridge the gap between\r\nthe Schri::idinger and Liouville formalisms (see Chapter 5). All of these iterative approaches\r\ncan be used to calculate singlet-to-triplet yields when the strength of the\r\noscillating magnetic field is weak compared to the other terms in the spin Hamiltonian.\r\nThis range occurs both in the natural magnetic environment (where oscillating fields\r\ntend to be smaller than 0.03 G and steady fields tend to be near 0.5 G) and in many\r\nman-made environments. Thus, these perturbation treatments should be applicable\r\nboth in studies of magnetic sensory mechanisms in animals and in studies of health\r\neffects of electromagnetic fields. These perturbation methods also allow much faster\r\ncalculation of singlet-to-triplet yields than do numerical integration methods and are more generally applicable than the rotating frame treatment, allowing treatment of\r\nanisotropic spin Hamiltonians and treatment of multiple oscillating fields at any orientation\r\nwith respect to the steady field. Finally, the different perturbation methods\r\ncomplement each other; that is, the Liouville Equation method yields a more efficient\r\nand reliable computer algorithm while the Schrodinger Equation method yields more\r\ninsight into how effects of steady and oscillating magnetic fields occur and can more\r\neasily be used to generate analytical expressions for field and frequency dependences of\r\nsinglet-to-triplet yields. Also, while the Liouville formalism allows one to calculate effects\r\non steady and oscillating field sensitivity of different escape rates (ks and kr) for\r\nsinglet and triplet pairs and can be generalized to include relaxation, the Schrodinger\r\nformalism lets one treat both exponential and Noyes time-dependences. Together\r\nthese new methods can be quite useful for studying biological effects of oscillating\r\nmagnetic fields, and their sample results show a number of behaviors in the singletto-\r\ntriplet yields (such as saturation effects, oscillating field strength and frequency\r\nresonances, and steady field strength- and orientation- dependent frequency shifts)\r\nthat, while typical in quantum mechanics or magnetic resonance, seem surprising in\r\nbiology and may account for conflicts in the magnetic field bioeffects literature.\r\nAlso during my graduate work I have used EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance)\r\ndata for the cage radical pairs formed by the homolytic cleavage of Co-C bonds\r\nin several coenzyme B12 dependent enzymes to calculate effects of earth-strength\r\nsteady and oscillating magnetic fields on their singlet-to-triplet yields via the radical\r\npair mechanism (see [7] or Chapter 6). Energy level repulsions and the state-mixing\r\nthey induce are found to be very important for determining overall sizes of effects and\r\nlower bounds on oscillating-field frequencies that can cause effects in such systems.\r\nB12 and similar systems with nearly axial zero-field spin Hamiltonians, dominated by\r\nterms over 100 times larger than Zeeman terms due to earth-strength steady fields,\r\nif under relatively immobile conditions of long lifetime, slow molecular tumbling, and\r\nslow spin relaxation, may be useful as biological sensors of both steady and oscillating\r\nfields that occur in nature, since the yields calculated show sensitivity to steady\r\nfield strength (even after powder averaging) and orientation, and undergo steadyfield-\r\ndependent shifts in the oscillating-field frequencies of maximal effect. Thus,\r\nsince B12 is used by a number of enzymes (including ribonucleotide reductase, which\r\nconverts RNA to DNA nucleotides; methyl malonyl CoA mutase, which controls the\r\nmetabolism of certain fatty acids in mammals; and methionine synthase, which in\r\nmammals is used to regenerate active methyl groups on S-adenosyl methionine, which\r\nis involved in DNA methylation, melatonin and epinephrine synthesis, myelination, and methylation of chemotaxis proteins) and since some of these B12-dependent processes\r\nhave been reported to be influenced by magnetic fields, coenzyme B12 may be\r\nan interesting candidate target for magnetic field effects in biology.U of I Onlydissertation/thesi", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text", "dissertation/thesis"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291725900", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/30772"]}, {"authors": ["Elliott, Timothy Scott"], "title": "Molecular analyses of differences in gene expression due to changes in the level of dietary fat", "description": "Dietary fat has been shown to exacerbate important chronic diseases including, heart disease, obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and cancer. This thesis described studies carried out to further our understanding of genes whose expression is altered by the level of dietary fat. The experimental approach was designed to obtain basic information in virgin female mice whose responses to dietary fat were not confounded by the production of a mammary tumor virus, hormonal events of pregnancy or the use of a chemical carcinogen. I have used molecular biology techniques to identify genes regulated by different levels of dietary fat. cDNA libraries were constructed from mammary tissue of virgin female Balb/c mice (7wks) fed a fat free diet for one week and then switched to either a 3 or 20% corn oil (co) diet for 2 wks. Subtractive hybridization of the lowfat cDNA library revealed genes expressed preferentially by mice fed the 3% co diet. These clones are designated lowfat mammary 1 and 2 (LFM-1, LFM-2). The diet regulated LFM-1 is a homolog to an UV-inducible gene. Since DNA repair enzymes are also induced by UV-irradiation, the identification of this single gene suggests that genes involved in DNA repair also may be regulated by dietary fat. Regulation of DNA repair genes by different levels of dietary fat may provide the first experimental link between the high fat diet and promotion of specific diseases.The second diet-specific cDNA, LFM-2, had homology to stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) which is the rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids from acetyl-CoA in animal tissues. The regulation of SCD by dietary fat is not well understood at this time. The physiological importance of SCD is probably related to the production of oleic acid which is the major fatty acid constituent in mouse depot fat. In conclusion, the data presented in this thesis showed that different levels of dietary fat as 3 and 20% corn oil, can modulate the expression of specific genes. The identification of diet regulated genes will be useful in gaining understanding of the influence of macronutrients on tissue physiology and development.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291719367", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/23591"]}, {"authors": ["Lehnert, James Patrick"], "title": "Studies on the Biology and Immunology of Ascaris Suum in Mice", "description": "309 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1967.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291755930", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/62340"]}, {"authors": ["Sanford, James Walker"], "title": "Observations on the Biology and Control of the Dusky Sap Beetle, Carpophilus Lugubris (Murray), Infesting Sweet Corn in Illinois", "description": "60 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1963.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29160850", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/58565"]}, {"authors": ["Fritz, Gary Gruber"], "title": "An Investigation of the Concept Dimension of Teaching Strategies of Bolivian Teachers in Biology", "description": "163 p.Thesis (Educat.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1971.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29164712", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/62454"]}, {"authors": ["Berger, Jacques"], "title": "The Morphology, Systematics, and Biology of The Entocommensal Ciliates Of Echinoids", "description": "541 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1964.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29164571", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/62314"]}, {"authors": ["Gorske, Stanley Francis"], "title": "Studies of the Biology, Taxonomy, and Herbicidal Effects on Portulaca Oleracea L", "description": "91 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1978.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29170811", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/68600"]}, {"authors": ["Spring, Bryan Quilty"], "title": "Development &Amp; Application of Fluorescence Spectroscopy &Amp; Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging to Biology &Amp; Medicine", "description": "232 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.The dissertation is concerned with biophysical applications of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and development and application of fluorescence lifetime-resolved imaging microscopy (FLIM).

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation, are one of the mechanisms by which histones (the protein component of chromatin) signal changes in very dynamic nuclear networks. Here new types of mass spectrometry (MS) are used to decipher histone PTMs as they occur in combination, to generate a global view of all the modification networks throughout the genome, an initial step towards understanding the role they play human cells.Developments in technology have revolutionized our view of how post-translational switches can effect protein function and mass spectrometry has certainly helped propel the chromatin field in new directions. Unlike other MS based techniques, top down mass spectrometry, preserves all modified histone forms given that the sample in analyzed at the intact protein level. This methodology also allows for characterization of highly similar protein variants which are members of the same family. Protein forms expressed by human cells (H2B) and different rat tissues (H2A and H2B) were determined by top down MS. Using electron capture dissociation (ECD) for MS/MS of H2B isoforms, direct evidence for the expression of eight unmodified H2B forms and monoacetylated H2B.A was obtained from asynchronous HeLa cells. Surprisingly, the expression profile of H2B forms did not change in HeLa cells arrested in mitosis by colchicine or during mid-S, mid-G2, G2/M, and mid-G1 phases of the cell cycle. H2A and H2B variants did not show expression dynamics in different subsections of rat brain or different rat tissues.We have also developed a top down-like approach (middle down) which analyzes large peptides to characterize PTM profiles on histone H3. Interestingly, we were able to conclude that methylation and acetylation levels on histone H3 are highly effected by perturbations of DNA methylation.

Canopy architecture and biomass allocation change as plants mature, and can affect light interception and carbon budgets. Thus plant growth forms are expected to affect the light requirements of plants, and are therefore expected to influence demographic patterns.Measurements of plant architecture, biomass allocation, and light interception were taken from plant in the field, and photosynthesis was measured on plants in the growing house. Plant growth and demography studies were based on three years of data from natural populations.Compared to Scheelea, Socratea has less leaf overlap, leaves more horizontally displayed, lower biomass allocation to leaves, higher leaf turnover, lower photosynthetic rates, and lower ability to acclimate photosynthetically to higher light conditions. Socratea's efficient display of shade-adapted leaves allows it to reach maturity under relatively closed canopy or in small gaps. Socratea grows vertically even as a seedling, and can attain high density in the old forest on BCI. Scheelea tolerates understory conditions as a seedling, but as leaf overlap and proportion of non-photosynthetic biomass increase, it reaches a stage at which a large gap in the canopy is required for further growth. Scheelea persists in the understory as suppressed individuals, and partly due to the large gap requirement, the adults are widely scattered in the old forest.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29173482", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/71283"]}, {"authors": ["Chang, Youngjung"], "title": "Global Optimization in Systems Biology and Bioinformatics", "description": "150 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.Identification of transcription factor binding motif and sites is a crucial effort to elucidate gene regulatory networks and its combinatorial problem is   NP -hard.

Furthermore, results suggested that temperature affected both follicle state and the quantity and quality of depot fats in overwintering females.

However, the results showed that females from the coldest area of the site lost their initial fat reserves at a slower rate than those collected from the warmest area.

For this reason, it is a priority to develop methods to evaluate the degree of exposure and contamination of estuarine natural populations in order to minimise the impact of human activities.\r\nBiomarkers have been widely used in ecotoxicology as early warning signals of chemicals effects, offering the possibility of anticipating severe alterations at a population level and, thus, making possible a protective intervention. Among the biomarkers potentially available for use, in this study attention was focused on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alterations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and induction of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the monooxygenase enzymes associated to P450 system (P450), which have been shown to be appropriate for use in a large variety of species and real scenarios.\r\nThe aim of the present work was to develop a battery of biomarkers on natural populations of Pomatoschistus microps (Kr\u00f8yer, 1838) in order to assess the effect of environmental contaminants in estuaries from the Atlantic Iberian coast. For this purpose three studies with distinct objectives were carried out: (i) characterization of the cholinesterase forms present in head tissues of P. microps; (ii) identification in P. micropsof suitable biomarkers to assess the environmental contaminant 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA); (iii) assessment of different contamination impacts in estuaries of the Norwest Portuguese coast using the selected biomarkers.\r\nExposure to DCA induced important alterations at histological and biochemical levels, that indicate this compound as potentially toxic for natural populations of P. micropsin estuaries with agricultural influence. The results obtained with the assessment of environmental contamination support the usefulness of the biomarker approach at different levels of biological organization to assess the toxicity of environmental pollution, and provide further support for the use of P. microps as a biomonitor in estuaries of the Iberian coast", "publisher": "Universidade de Aveiro", "subjects": ["masterThesis"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/132282905.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132282905.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/132282905", "http://hdl.handle.net/10773/19065"]}, {"authors": ["Almeida, Salom\u00e9 Fernandes Pinheiro de"], "title": "Utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das diatom\u00e1ceas na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade das \u00e1guas doces", "description": "Doutoramento em BiologiaNo curso inferior de alguns dos rios pertencentes \u00e0 bacia hidr\u00f3gr\u00e1fica do rio Vouga e em tr\u00eas valas de reconhecida import\u00e2ncia para a rega dos f\u00e9rteis terrenos adjacentes, localizaram-se\r\ndezoito esta\u00e7\u00f5es de amostragem que foram, durante cerca de um ano e meio, estudadas com uma periodicidade aproximadamente mensa1.

The taxonomic composition and patterns in biodiversity, abundance and community structure of the\r\nbenthic macrofauna were described. Annelida(42.1% of total abundance; 137 species) and Arthropoda (20.6%; 162 species) were, respectively, the most abundant and the most species-rich Phyla among the 342 taxa identified during this study. Multivariate analyses showed significant differences between and within canyons and between canyons and open slope assemblages. At their upper section, canyons supported higher macrofauna abundance but slightly lower biodiversity than the adjacent slopes at similar depth. In all canyons abundance reached the highest value in the middle section and the lowest in the upper section, with marked fluctuations in Nazar\u00e9 (474\u20134599 ind.m2) and lower variability in Cascais (583\u20131125 ind.m2). The high abundance and dominance of the assemblages in the middle section of Nazar\u00e9 and Set\u00fabal was accompanied by depressed biodiversity, while in Cascais, Hurlbert\u2019s expected species richnes sshowed increasing values from theupper to the middle canyon, and maintained the high values at the lower section. Overall, the Nazar\u00e9 Canyon showed the lowest expected species richness (ES(100): 16\u201339) and the Cascais Canyon the highest(39\u201354). There was a significant negative Kendall\u2019s correlation between total organic carbon concentrations in the superficial sediments and ES(100) and a significant positive correlation between total nitrogen and macrofauna density. The influences oforganic enrichment, sediment heterogeneity and hydrodynamic regime on the abundance, diversity and community structure of the macrofauna are discussed. It is suggested that altered and localised environmental conditions in the Portuguese canyons play an important role in modifying more common abundance and diversity bathymetric patterns evident in many continental slope environments.European Commission - GOCE-CT-2005-511234HERMIONE - 226354FCT - SFRH/BPD/21459/2005FCT - SFRH/BPD/22383/2005FCT - SFRH/BD/16563/2004FCT - SFRH/BD/17085/2004HERMES projec", "doi": "10.1016/j.dsr2.2011.04.007", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["article"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/15564608.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/15564608.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/15564608", "http://hdl.handle.net/10773/4452"]}, {"authors": ["De Sanctis, S.", "Malloni, W.M.", "Kremer, W.", "Tom\u00e9, A.M.", "Lang, E.W.", "Neidig, K.-P.", "Kalbitzer, H.R."], "title": "Singular spectrum analysis for an automated solvent artifact removal and baseline correction of 1D NMR spectra", "description": "NMR spectroscopy in biology and medicine is generally performed in aqueous solutions, thus in 1H NMR spectroscopy, the dominant signal often stems from the partly suppressed solvent and can be many orders of magnitude larger than the resonances of interest. Strong solvent signals lead to a disappearance of weak resonances of interest close to the solvent artifact and to base plane variations all over the spectrum. The AUREMOL-SSA/ALS approach for automated solvent artifact removal and baseline correction has been originally developed for multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Here, we describe the necessary adaptations for an automated application to one-dimensional NMR spectra. Its core algorithm is still based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) applied on time domain signals (FIDs) and it is still combined with an automated baseline correction (ALS) in the frequency domain. However, both steps (SSA and ALS) have been modified in order to achieve optimal results when dealing with one-dimensional spectra. The performance of the method has been tested on one-dimensional synthetic and experimental spectra including the back-calculated spectrum of HPr protein and an experimental spectrum of a human urine sample. The latter has been recorded with the typically used NOESY-type 1D pulse sequence including water pre-saturation. Furthermore, the fully automated AUREMOL-SSA/ALS procedure includes the managing of oversampled, digitally filtered and zero-filled data and the correction of the frequency domain phase shift caused by the group delay time shift from the digital finite response filtering.Bavarian Science Foundation (ForNeuroCell)European Union (SPINE-2)Fonds of the Chemical Industry (FCI", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmr.2011.03.001", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["article"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/15566088", "http://hdl.handle.net/10773/5301"]}, {"authors": ["Andr\u00e9, M\u00f3nica Jo\u00e3o de Barros Amorim"], "title": "Efeitos de v\u00e1rias propriedades do solo em testes ecotoxicol\u00f3gicos", "description": "Doutoramento em BiologiaSoil ecotoxicology studies are usually performed in standard soils, such as\r\nOECD artificial soil or LUFA, a natural soil.

This review highlights\u00c2\u00a0in vitro\u00c2\u00a0models that may be used as preclinical models, accelerating the drug development process towards more precise and personalized standard of care for cancer patients. We describe the state-of-the art of 3D\u00c2\u00a0in vitro\u00c2\u00a0culture systems, with a focus on how these different approaches could be coupled in order to achieve a compromise between standardization and reliability in recapitulating tumor microenvironment and drug response.European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 under grant agreement n\u00ba 668983 \u2014 FoReCaST (Forefront Research in 3D Disease Cancer Models as in vitro Screening Technologies) and FRONTHERA project (Frontiers of technology for theranostics of cancer, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases; grant agreement: NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-0000232).

It was from localities around these shores\r\nthat a long whaling tradition started in the XI century. For more than 600 hundred years the Right whale was\r\ncaught along these coasts until the decline of whaling in the XVIII century. Modem whaling started in Spain at\r\nthe beginning of the XX century in the Gibraltar Straits. In the second half of the century whaling activity\r\ncontinued in the north west of the Iberian Peninsula. The target species were sperm and fin whale. The interest\r\nin cetacean studies on the Spanish coast goes back to the XVIII century with the works of pioneers such as\r\nSarmiento and Comide and continued with the monographic works by Graells and Cabrera. Since the last quarter\r\nof the past century an extraordinary boom in the number of studies on cetaceans in the Bay of Biscay has taken\r\nplace. About thirty cetacean species ha ve been reported in the Bay of Biscay, seven belonging to Mysticeti and\r\ntwenty three to Odontoceti. Precise knowledge on the biology, distribution and migratory pattems are restricted\r\nto some of them whilst absolute abundance estimations are lacking for the majority of the species. Further\r\nresearch is needed in these areas. One of the main concems for the conservation of cetacean populations in the\r\nBay of Biscay is the interaction with fisheries. Other threats are related to the degradation of the marine\r\nenvironment due to chemical waste and the increase in noise pollution. Several conventions deal with the\r\nmanagement and conservation of cetaceans. At the European and Spanish level, there are also several regulations\r\nconceming the protection of the local populations and their habitats. A Spanish Decree on whale watching is in\r\nan advanced state of development. Humans and cetaceans are both part of complex marine ecosystems.

However, two limiting factors should be taken into account before considering PGCs as an ideal cell source for germplasm banking: 1) The existence of a limited number of cells/embryo 2) The necessity of adequate transplantation methods that guarantee genital ridge PGC colonization. Therefore, in order to ensure their contribution to the germline, PGCs must retained their migration capacity after thawing, and in most cases host embryo/larva should be sterilized to avoid endogenous contribution to the germ line. Several cryopreservation and vitrification protocols have been proposed in different species and genetic and epigenetic studies have been performed in order to analyze the effect of freezing/thawing in these cells. Many studies reported promising results confirming PGC genital ridge colonization and even the production of gametes able to produced live fry.

Despite the attention given to and the controversy engendered by the biology of these flies, both by applied entomologists concerned with the flies' status as agricultural pests and by evolutionary biologists interested in modes of speciation, this is the first study to provide substantial support for genetic differentiation for traits important in host selection and in maintenance of reproductive isolation among these sibling species and host-associated populations.Interspecific or interpopulational crosses have demonstrated three levels of partial barriers to hybridization. First, a measure of temporal isolation among host-associated populations is afforded by genetic control of seasonal divergence in post-diapause eclosion patterns. Second, the combined effects of the use of (a) the host plant as a rendezvous site for mating and (b) genetic differences among these flies for oviposition response to actual host fruits and to artificial fruits of different sizes limit the opportunity for encounter between flies from different populations. Third, even if interspecific encounters occur, differences in mating response and egg hatch success further reduce the potential for introgression.It is essential to emphasize that, while these factors must be important in maintaining reproductive isolation among these sibling species or host-associated populations of the R. pomonella group, it should not be concluded from this study that these factors were responsible for the divergence and subsequent speciation. Therefore, these results should not be construed as evidence in direct support of the hypothesis of sympatric speciation by these host-associated fruit flies.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29173301", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/71102"]}, {"authors": ["Martin, Hector Garcia"], "title": "Statistical Analysis of Highly Correlated Systems in Biology and Physics", "description": "216 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2004.I have also used Path Integral Monte Carlo techniques to explore the limit of rapid rotations, where the Gross-Pitaevskii equation is no longer valid.

Many areas of research in catalysis, energy development, semiconductor physics, materials science, biology, and medicine require high technology in surface science. The principle advantage of photoacoustic spectroscopy is that it permits the acquisition of optical spectra similar to those from optical transmission spectroscopy on the surface of any type of opaque condensed phase material.The photoacoustic effect is an energy conversion process transforming light energy into acoustic energy. In the absence of fluorescence and photochemical reactions, the absorption of modulated monochromatic light by a sample manifest itself as a periodic thermal fluctuation at the modulation frequency as a result of nonradiative de-excitation processes within the sample. The resultant heat flow into the surrounding gas creates a periodic pressure change detected by a sensitive microphone in an enclosed cell.A lockin amplifier is used to enhance the signal-to-noise of the microphone output. The analog output from the lockin amplifier is transferred to the digital domain with a 10 KHz voltage-to-frequency converter. An ADD-8080 microcomputer provides the artificial intelligence for the automated photoacoustic spectrometer. BASIC language programming allows operator control of the experimental instrumental parameters and flexibility in data manipulation and graphical display.The single beam photoacoustic spectrometer was constructed from a 300W high intensity Eimac xenon lamp, Heath monochromator, and Brookdeal 9505E lockin amplifier. The detector was a one-inch diameter General Radio electret microphone.

Nowhere is this question more compelling than in the case of sibling cells, where each is derived from the single division of a parental cell. This thesis identifies two proteins involved in generating differences in sibling cells. The numb protein is asymmetrically localized to the cortex of dividing precursor cells in the Drosophila central and peripheral nervous systems. numb is then segregated into only one of the progeny cells where it is necessary and sufficient to autonomously specify that cell's fate. numb functions to specify cell fate by repressing extrinsic cell signalling factors. The prospero protein is also asymmetrically localized to the cortex of dividing precursor cells in the Drosophila central and peripheral nervous system and gut. The prospero protein is then localized to the nucleus of the progeny cell where it regulates gene expression. By regulating gene expression in only one progeny cell, prospero makes the sibling cells different. Correct localization of prospero in the precursor cell requires entry into mitosis and the asymmetric localization of prospero and numb are independent of each other. Thus, numb and prospero are determinants that are asymmetrically localized during cell division to generate differences in sibling cells by unique mechanisms. A gene required for correct prospero expression within a specific glial lineage and the role of prospero in eye development are also examined.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4829694", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/21271"]}, {"authors": ["Liao, Birong"], "title": "Biochemical characterization of calmodulin isoforms and identification of calmodulin-binding proteins in Arabidopsis", "description": "A central question in plant biology is how plant cells discriminate among diverse stimuli to generate precise physiological responses when many stimuli and their responses are coupled by the same signal of changes in intracellular Ca$\\sp{2+}$ concentration. The identification of four calmodulin (CaM) isoforms in Arabidopsis provides a good opportunity to address this fundamental question. The goal of this research was to address whether CaM isoforms confer specificity to Ca$\\sp{2+}$-mediated signal transduction pathways. A combination of in vitro biochemical enzyme activation and molecular biological approaches were employed to tackle this question. First, CaM isoforms produced from E. coli expression systems were used to test their abilities to activate pea NAD kinase. There was a small, but significant difference among the CaM isoforms' ability to activate pea NAD kinase in vitro. Minor differences in K$\\sb{0.5}$, but not V$\\sb{\\rm max}$, were observed between CaM isoforms and chimeric proteins tagged at their N-termini with a 12-residue c-myc epitope. Nonsense mutations of the C-terminal 7 residues of CaM-6 (CaM-6M), however, drastically impaired the ability of the protein to activate NAD kinase. The requirement for free Ca$\\sp{2+}$ to activate NAD kinase by wt and mutant CaM-6 proteins was identical. In contrast, CaM-6M bound synthetic peptide substrates with lower apparent affinity than CaM-6. Because of the importance of NAD kinase as a model system for studying CaM structure and function relationships, a systematic series of experiments were performed to purify NAD kinase with the goal of obtaining direct amino acid sequence information. The method reported here yielded higher purity of the enzyme ($\\sim$5000 fold) with enhanced enzyme stability than any previously published methods. Methods of detecting CaM-binding proteins (CaM-BPs) were optimized by conjugating several reporter molecules CaM. The feasibilities of conjugates as ligand probes for detecting CaM-BPs in protein fractions after separation in SDS-PAGE and in screening cDNA expression library were evaluated. Thirty-two clones encoding putative CaM-BPs were isolated from an Arabidopsis flower library. Eighteen clones were partially sequenced.

This goal seems reasonable considering the known roles of many biological\r\nfree radicals in cancer, disease, aging, development, and cellular signaling,\r\nthe constant reminders in the media to take anti-oxidant vitamins to protect against\r\ndangerous free radicals, and the success of the radical pair mechanism in explaining\r\nmagnetic field effects in photosynthetic reaction centers. The radical pair mechanism\r\n(as detailed in Chapter 2) occurs when a pair of radicals forms a cage radical pair,\r\na system composed of two unpaired electron spins whose spin motion is affected by\r\nnearby nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction, by applied magnetic fields via the\r\nZeeman effect, and by each other via the exchange and dipole interactions. The spin\r\nmotion varies in singlet/triplet character, and if the chemical reaction is more (or less)\r\nfavorable in a singlet/triplet state, the reaction rate can depend on applied magnetic\r\nfields, even ones very weak and near earth-strength.\r\nTo approach the above goal, during my graduate work I have developed and published\r\nseveral new perturbation treatments for combinations of steady and oscillating\r\nmagnetic fields in the radical pair mechanism: one based on the Schri::idinger Equation\r\n(see [4, 5] or Chapter 3), another based on the Liouville Equation (see [6] or\r\nChapter 4), and two more mixed perturbation methods that bridge the gap between\r\nthe Schri::idinger and Liouville formalisms (see Chapter 5). All of these iterative approaches\r\ncan be used to calculate singlet-to-triplet yields when the strength of the\r\noscillating magnetic field is weak compared to the other terms in the spin Hamiltonian.\r\nThis range occurs both in the natural magnetic environment (where oscillating fields\r\ntend to be smaller than 0.03 G and steady fields tend to be near 0.5 G) and in many\r\nman-made environments. Thus, these perturbation treatments should be applicable\r\nboth in studies of magnetic sensory mechanisms in animals and in studies of health\r\neffects of electromagnetic fields. These perturbation methods also allow much faster\r\ncalculation of singlet-to-triplet yields than do numerical integration methods and are more generally applicable than the rotating frame treatment, allowing treatment of\r\nanisotropic spin Hamiltonians and treatment of multiple oscillating fields at any orientation\r\nwith respect to the steady field. Finally, the different perturbation methods\r\ncomplement each other; that is, the Liouville Equation method yields a more efficient\r\nand reliable computer algorithm while the Schrodinger Equation method yields more\r\ninsight into how effects of steady and oscillating magnetic fields occur and can more\r\neasily be used to generate analytical expressions for field and frequency dependences of\r\nsinglet-to-triplet yields. Also, while the Liouville formalism allows one to calculate effects\r\non steady and oscillating field sensitivity of different escape rates (ks and kr) for\r\nsinglet and triplet pairs and can be generalized to include relaxation, the Schrodinger\r\nformalism lets one treat both exponential and Noyes time-dependences. Together\r\nthese new methods can be quite useful for studying biological effects of oscillating\r\nmagnetic fields, and their sample results show a number of behaviors in the singletto-\r\ntriplet yields (such as saturation effects, oscillating field strength and frequency\r\nresonances, and steady field strength- and orientation- dependent frequency shifts)\r\nthat, while typical in quantum mechanics or magnetic resonance, seem surprising in\r\nbiology and may account for conflicts in the magnetic field bioeffects literature.\r\nAlso during my graduate work I have used EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance)\r\ndata for the cage radical pairs formed by the homolytic cleavage of Co-C bonds\r\nin several coenzyme B12 dependent enzymes to calculate effects of earth-strength\r\nsteady and oscillating magnetic fields on their singlet-to-triplet yields via the radical\r\npair mechanism (see [7] or Chapter 6). Energy level repulsions and the state-mixing\r\nthey induce are found to be very important for determining overall sizes of effects and\r\nlower bounds on oscillating-field frequencies that can cause effects in such systems.\r\nB12 and similar systems with nearly axial zero-field spin Hamiltonians, dominated by\r\nterms over 100 times larger than Zeeman terms due to earth-strength steady fields,\r\nif under relatively immobile conditions of long lifetime, slow molecular tumbling, and\r\nslow spin relaxation, may be useful as biological sensors of both steady and oscillating\r\nfields that occur in nature, since the yields calculated show sensitivity to steady\r\nfield strength (even after powder averaging) and orientation, and undergo steadyfield-\r\ndependent shifts in the oscillating-field frequencies of maximal effect. Thus,\r\nsince B12 is used by a number of enzymes (including ribonucleotide reductase, which\r\nconverts RNA to DNA nucleotides; methyl malonyl CoA mutase, which controls the\r\nmetabolism of certain fatty acids in mammals; and methionine synthase, which in\r\nmammals is used to regenerate active methyl groups on S-adenosyl methionine, which\r\nis involved in DNA methylation, melatonin and epinephrine synthesis, myelination, and methylation of chemotaxis proteins) and since some of these B12-dependent processes\r\nhave been reported to be influenced by magnetic fields, coenzyme B12 may be\r\nan interesting candidate target for magnetic field effects in biology.U of I Onlydissertation/thesi", "subjects": ["text", "dissertation/thesis"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4838607", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/30772"]}, {"authors": ["Beckstead, Julie"], "title": "A Community's Natural Resistance to Invasion by Cheatgrass and the Effects of Associational Herbivory", "description": "126 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2001.Linking theories of invasion biology with that of associational herbivory, I found that (1) cheatgrass was a highly utilized food source for generalist grasshoppers, (2) among native plant species, the amount of herbivory corresponded with their total percent nitrogen and other plant traits, and (3) a native grass, Elymus elymoides, experienced higher herbivory in high- than in low-density cheatgrass patches, supporting the attractant-source hypothesis that predicts associational susceptibility.

Finally, predictions of a model that compares the metabolic rate to different avenues of heat loss, are related to the data presented and to the biology of guanacos.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291715463", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/19677"]}, {"authors": ["Edwards, Dale Ivan"], "title": "Biology and Host-Parasite Relations of the Stem Nematode of Onion, Ditylenchus Dipsaci (Kuhn, 1857) Filipjev, 1936", "description": "76 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1962.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291751905", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/58262"]}, {"authors": ["Bayer, Benjamin John"], "title": "Varieties of Naturalized Epistemology: Criticisms and Alternatives", "description": "270 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2007.Naturalized epistemology---the recent attempt to transform the theory of knowledge into a branch of natural science---is often criticized for dispensing with the distinctively philosophical content of epistemology. In this dissertation, I argue that epistemologists are correct to reject naturalism, but that new arguments are needed to show why this is so. I establish my thesis first by evaluating two prominent varieties of naturalism---optimistic and pessimistic---and then by offering a proposal for how a new version of non-naturalistic epistemology must move forward. Optimistic naturalism attempts to use scientific methods to give positive answers to traditional epistemological questions. Epistemologists, for example, are urged to draw on psychology and evolutionary biology in order to show our beliefs are justified. I argue that this project fails. First, the naturalist's thesis that theory is underdetermined by evidence poses difficulties for the optimist's attempt to show that our beliefs are justified, even according to naturalized standards. Second, while critics usually contest naturalists' logical right to use the concept of normative justification, I suggest that a deeper problem is with the naturalists' use of the concept of belief. Naturalistic philosophy of mind, while perhaps acceptable for other purposes, does not deliver a concept of \"belief\" consistent with the constraints and needs of naturalized epistemology. Pessimistic naturalism---Quine's project---takes it for granted that \"belief\" is problematic and logical justification elusive, and instead offers a pragmatic account of the development of our theory of the world. This project, while deeply unsatisfactory to the traditional epistemologist, also faces the challenge of privileging scientific discourse over other pragmatically successful modes of discourse. Whatever its merits, we can undermine its motivation by challenging the underdetermination thesis it rests on. We can do this by appealing to facts about scientific practice that undermine the conception of confirmation driving the thesis, by appealing to other facts about scientific practice, and by challenging some philosophical preconceptions, in order to make room for a new brand of inductivist foundationalism.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291779138", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/87602"]}, {"authors": ["Yershova, Ganna"], "title": "Sampling and Searching Methods for Practical Motion Planning Algorithms", "description": "110 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.In its original conception, the motion planning problem considered the search of a robot path from an initial to a goal configuration. The study of motion planning has advanced significantly in recent years, in large part due to the development of highly successful sampling and searching techniques. Recent advances have influenced sampling-based motion planning algorithms to be used in disparate areas such as humanoid robotics, automotive manufacturing, spacecraft navigation, architecture, computational geography, computer graphics, and computational biology. Many of these methods work well on a large set of problems, however, they have weaknesses and limitations. This thesis expands the basic motion planning techniques to include critical concerns that are not covered by the motion planning algorithms that are in widespread use now. The technical approach is organized around three main thrusts: (1) the development of efficient nearest neighbor searching techniques for spaces arising in motion planning; (2) the development of uniform sampling techniques on these spaces to allow resolution completeness in sampling-based planning algorithms; and (3) the development of guided sampling techniques for efficient exploration on such spaces. Addressing these core issues in motion planning does not only lead to a more fundamental understanding of the problem, but also to more efficient practical algorithms.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291773375", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/81838"]}, {"authors": ["Frederick, Betz Rosalie"], "title": "Structural and status barriers to participation in mathematics, science, and computer studies: A case study", "description": "The purpose of this case study was to explore whether the structure of the curriculum and the status of students acted as barriers to participation in mathematics, science, and computer studies. The setting of the study was a culturally diverse community in the Midwest. Three status classifications, SES, gender, and the combination of SES and gender, were used as lenses to view the curriculum. The transcripts of 254 students were analyzed.SES was found to be associated with differential participation between programs in mathematics and science but gender was not. A larger percentage of high-SES students were in the college preparatory programs in mathematics and science than other SES groups, but approximately equal percentages of females and males were in these programs.Within the general studies program, SES and gender were not associated with differential participation. Graduation requirements appeared to set a floor on how much mathematics and science students elected to take. A third of the students in the community graduated completing 1.5 years of mathematics and 50% graduated completing a year of science. Within the college preparatory programs, SES and gender were associated with differential participation in mathematics. Medium- and high-SES students and males completed more mathematics than low-SES students and females. SES and gender was not associated with differential participation in science and computer studies. College preparatory females of low-, medium-, and high-SES completed the same median number of years of mathematics. The median number of years of mathematics completed by males increased as SES increased. The median number of years of science completed increased for both females and males as SES increased. SES and gender were associated with differential participation in advanced mathematics, science and computer studies. A higher percentage of males and high-SES students participated in advanced mathematics, science and computer studies than females and other SES groups.Females with the same ability as males in terms of grades in Algebra 3-4, science and Basic Programming did not enroll in advanced courses in these subjects at the same rate as males. Females in the college preparatory science program were more likely than males to enroll in Advanced Biology rather than Physics or Advanced Chemistry. Seventy percent of the students taking computer studies courses completed college preparatory programs in both mathematics and science although this was not a prerequisite.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291716704", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/20922"]}, {"authors": ["Sanderfoot, Anton Arnold"], "title": "Determination of the molecular mechanism of cell-to-cell movement in squash leaf curl geminivirus", "description": "The intercellular spread of plant viruses is an essential process with extensive implications for the life cycle of the virus, and the cell biology of the host. In all plant viruses, intercellular spread is accomplished by a special class of viral encoded protein, termed movement proteins (MPs). The work of this thesis is the study of the MPs of squash leaf curl geminivirus. Unlike most plant viruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells, geminiviruses have genomes of DNA, and must replicate in the nucleus. Thus, the nuclear membrane poses an additional barrier to cell-to-cell spread. To overcome this block, I propose that SqLCV encodes two MPs: a nuclear shuttle (BR1) to transport the ssDNA progeny as a BR1:ssDNA complex between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments; and a second MP (BL1) which functions to transport the BR1:ssDNA complexes across the cell wall into adjacent cells. I will show that this movement is coordinated through specific protein:protein interactions between the two MPs in a process which provides directionality to movement. Further, I will delimit the regions (domains) in each MP which are responsible for the functions of subcellular targeting and protein:protein interaction. Finally, I will discuss the potential for post-translational phosphorylation in regulating subcellular targeting and interaction between the MPs.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291717665", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/21885"]}, {"authors": ["Samson, Karen Margolis"], "title": "An Instructional Strategy for Helping Readers Identify the Gist in Expository Text", "description": "247 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1982.The objective of this two-week instructional study was to improve high school students' comprehension of biology text materials through use of an explicit instructional strategy. The Topic/Subtopic Strategy is a two-step procedure designed to enable readers to recognize relationships among key ideas in text by engaging readers in the active process of evaluating and synthesizing text segments. The Strategy emerged in the attempt to create a practical tool for helping readers discriminate between more important and less important ideas represented in text.The Topic/Subtopic Strategy requires readers in Step One to first analyze sentences in terms of TOPIC (what the sentence is about) and COMMENT (what is being said about the topic). Step Two involves grouping Topic/Comment elements according to relationship types in order to create important subtopics suggested by relevant information. In teaching this Strategy, the experimenter was interested in examining the extent to which Strategy instruction would affect readers' comprehension of gist information. Comprehension of gist was measured by recall and short-answer questions. While the Strategy group received instruction, a second treatment group, the Read-Study group, practiced reading, studying (using any method), and recalling information. Both the Strategy group and the Read-Study group used the same text passages. A Control group received regular classroom instruction.Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the data. This procedure enabled the experimenter to evaluate the unique effect of treatment both in isolation and as a function of various status variables. Findings suggest that the positive effects of Strategy learning on gist recall were limited to contextually-bound situations. In other words, evidence suggests that the Strategy may be effective for certain students under certain conditions. Overall main effects favoring Strategy effectiveness were found for the biology mid-test Passage 2 (on recall of secondary important propositions and question score). Significant interactions favoring the effectiveness of the Strategy varied across specific contextually-bound situations. In summary, results suggest that instruction in gist identification has a contextually-specific effect.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291762339", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/68810"]}, {"authors": ["Dong, Rui"], "title": "Microfluidic Devices for Bioanalytical Applications", "description": "161 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) based microfluidic devices have a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, environmental science and drug delivery.

A complete in vivo transcription map of the yeast centromere plasmid YCp19 was determined, and the transcripts from the plasmid borne genes were quantitated. A plasmid position effect on gene expression was observed. Although YCp19 was maintained like a yeast minichromosome at approximately one plasmid per cell, several yeast genes overexpressed their RNA 3 to 5-fold above their chromosomal counterparts. The negative superhelical density ($-$d) was measured for yeast/E. coli shuttle plasmids isolated from yeast ($-$d = 0.02) and from E. coli ($-$d = 0.04). The superhelical density did not change when plasmids containing galactose inducible genes were induced to actively transcribe these genes. These results would favor models involving subtle DNA conformational changes to explain transcriptional activation.Many attempts were made to reconstitute selective RNA polymerase II transcription initiation in vitro employing whole-cell protein extracts prepared from special genetically constructed yeast strains and employing supercoiled plasmid templates and the S1 nuclease protection assay. Although I failed to detect selective RNA polymerase II transcription initiation, I did observe selective transcription initiation by the yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase from several nuclear genes. These mitochondrial RNA polymerase transcripts initiate from the RNA polymerase II &quot;TATA&quot; box promoter elements. Three of these genes are involved in galactose metabolism which is enigmatically influenced by the mitochondria. Also, reports in the literature suggest a physiological role for the mitochondrial RNA polymerase in the nucleus.

Under the cost-benefit model, reptiles should thermoregulate carefully only when the benefits outweigh the costs. I test this model with quantitative comparisons between populations of ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta) experiencing different thermal conditions, and between ecologically similar species that differ in their expected thermoregulatory demands (ratsnakes and racers [ Coluber constrictor]) at the same Illinois location. I also examine the interdependence of habitat use (especially forest edges) and thermoregulatory behavior. Within populations, I examine the effects of season and sex on habitat use and thermal ecology. I use a combination of temperature-sensitive radio transmitters, data loggers to continuously record temperatures, GIS movement analyses, diet and prey availability analyses, and thermal indices that allow direct comparisons among studies. Snake habitat use was not associated with variation in mammal prey availability, and may at least be partly driven by thermoregulatory considerations. Ratsnakes in Illinois used upland forest similarly to those in Ontario. However, preference for thermally favorable edges in my study was weaker than found at the species' northern range limit. In contrast, racers may be confined to habitats that facilitate thermoregulation; preferring edges and successional fields, while avoiding forest interior. Racers were also more active relative to ratsnakes, using larger home ranges while moving further and more frequently through the season. Illinois ratsnakes maintained warmer temperatures closer to their preferred range relative to Ontario ratsnakes, but not as a result of more effective thermoregulation. Racers were also thermoconformers overall, and the least effective thermoregulators among the temperate-zone snakes studied thus far. Therefore, snakes may themoregulate most effectively in challenging environments, when the costs of thermoconformity would be high. However, racers were very effective thermoregulators at times when the relative benefits for doing so should have been greatest. The current cost-benefit model is a useful tool for explaining this aspect of snake biology. However, we need a better understanding of how the associated costs and benefits vary with the ecology of a given species.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291776909", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/85372"]}, {"authors": ["Toma, Daniel Patrick"], "title": "Cloning and Analysis of a Honey Bee (Apis Mellifera) Period Gene Ortholog and Honey Bee Division of Labor", "description": "59 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2000.1Winston, M.

Paleomicroevolutionary studies require accurate stratigraphic resolution over a large geographic area, through changing environments, over a sustained period of time, with an abundant, complex, eurytopic fossil group. The combination of cryptostome bryozoans, revised taxonomic procedures, multivariate morphometric methods, and advances in microcomputer technology allows for research of this nature.Multivariate analysis of a large morphometric data set demonstrates that discrete fenestrate bryozoan morphs can be recognized objectively at three hierarchical levels: species, genera and families. Recent studies of hard-part versus electrophoretic species recognition in cheilostome bryozoans and scleractinian corals support the interpretation that fenestrate species represent true biological species rather than morphotaxa. Morphometric analysis demonstrates that some characters are taxonomically more important than others, but use of all available characters yields the most reliable results.Worthenopora is a Mississippian cryptostome bryozoan tentatively assigned to the order Cheilostomata (Jurassic and younger) but some early workers. This alignment raises the question of affinities between cryptostomes (class Stenolaemata) and cheilostomes (class Gymnolaemata). Based on wall structure, growth sequence, zooecial shape, and secondary structures such as stylets, Worthenopora is here shown to be a stenolaemate, assignable to the suborder Ptilodictyina with other bifoliate cryptostomes, with no special affinities with cheilostomes.Paleontologic data frequently do not satisfy assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of many parametric statistical tests. Normal scores tests, which employ normal order deviates (rankits), provide an attractive alternative for treatment of such data. Computer programs Rankit and Mathematica provide a practical method of calculating rankits and converting raw data, making normal scores tests more accessible.Three-dimensional shapes of cryptostome bryozoan autozooecial chambers are important for systematics and paleoecologic interpretations, however, computer automation of three-dimensional reconstruction from serial sections is not yet practical.Based on morphometric analysis of the rhabdomesoid Streblotrypa prisca, ecophenotypic and geographic variation are significant factors for microevolutionary studies. Apparently non-astogenetic morphologic growth gradients are demonstrated with colonies of S. prisca. A morphologic cline distributed over a 300 km transect is demonstrated; control is unclear, but it may be associated with a depth gradient.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291719091", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/23314"]}, {"authors": ["Kallwitz, Karin Lynn"], "title": "Examination of N-(1-Naphthyl)leucine based chiral selectors via liquid-liquid extraction and HPLC", "description": "Thesis (B.S.) in Biology--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1992.Includes bibliographical references (leaf 19)U of I OnlyTheses restricted to UIUC community onl", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291742048", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/47765"]}, {"authors": ["Kendzior, Elizabeth Ann"], "title": "From College Student to Science Teacher--an Exploratory Study Based Upon the Experiences of Two Beginning Biology Teachers", "description": "141 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1971.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291756140", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/62549"]}, {"authors": ["Mallonee, Darrell Howard"], "title": "Genetic Enhancement of Microbial Production of 2,3-Butanediol (Bacillus Polymyxa)", "description": "187 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1985.The subject of this study was the genetic enhancement of 2,3-butanediol production by Bacillus polymyxa. Mutagenesis and cloning techniques were studied.A series of spontaneous and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced mutations were used to create a mutant strain of B. polymyxa ATCC 12321 which showed constitutive production of catabolic (alpha)-acetolactate synthase, a key enzyme in the 2,3-butanediol pathway. This mutant strain was shown to produce 2,3-butanediol and its immediate precursor acetoin somewhat earlier and in considerably greater quantities than the wild-type strain under a wide variety of fermentation conditions. The mutant strain also grew more slowly and displayed a different colony type than the wild-type strain.Since very little molecular biology work had been done with B. polymyxa, it was necessary to develop these techniques. Procedures were developed for growth of B. polymyxa on minimal media and for isolation of plasmid DNA from the microorganism.A penicillin-injured-cell transformation system was developed to transfer plasmid DNA to B. polymyxa. The system included transformation in a buffer containing Mg('++) ions and growth on a peptone-glucose-yeast extract selection medium.

The DNA sequence of the gene and its proximal flanking regions was determined and analyzed by using the programs available on the BIONET National Computer Resource for Molecular Biology. Such analysis provided the primary sequence of the protein and identified regions of DNA sequence which have structures related by symmetry operations. By analogy with the structure of sequences known to function in the control of gene expression, these regions may be those responsible for the observed expression properties of the cpo gene. The actual function of DNA sequences in the flanking regions remains to be determined. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA versions of the cpo gene sequence shows that the gene lacks introns and does not have the typical AATAAA polyadenylation signal. The start site of transcription was mapped by primer extension analysis and found conform to the general pattern of eukaryotic transcription initiation sites.

The major emphasis of this study concerned the taxonomic significance and the mechanism of HCN production by microorganisms, especially fungi.More than 250 species of fungi, primarily Basidiomycetes, were screened for cyanogenesis. Approximately 5% of these produced and accumulated detectable quantities of HCN. With few exceptions, cyanogenesis is restricted to members of the Agaricales and Aphyllophorales. Several literature reports of cyanogenic fungi are probably due to contamination of test materials with cyanogenic bacteria.Cyanogenic compounds extracted from mycelial cultures and basidiocarps of several agarics have properties identical to those of cyanohydrins, and are a minor source of the cyanide recovered from Maramsius oreades. This fungus synthesizes and liberates HCN from a precursor without the intermediate formation of cyanogenic compounds. Glycine was the most effective amino acid precursor to HCN.HCN production by basidiocarps of M. oreades was greatest at 23 C. Air was required for maximum synthesis of HCN, although low levels could be detected in a nitrogen environment. Cyanogenesis also was sensitive to buffer composition and had a pH optimum of 9.2. Mercuric chloride strongly inhibited the liberation of HCN.Pseudomonas chlororaphis, a cyanogenic bacterium, also was studied to provide a more thorough understanding of fungal cyanogenesis. Cyanogenesis primarily occurred during the transition from the logarithmic to the stationary phase of growth and was stimulated by glycine. Glyoxylate was nearly as effective as glycine in enhancing cyanogenesis. An alkaline-labile cyanogenic compound(s) accumulated in the medium of P. chlororaphis cultures. The formation of this compound was enhanced by the addition of glyoxylate and was shown to be derived from the non-enzymatic condensation of HCN and a free carbonyl compound. It is suggested that this is the mechanism of cyanogenic compound formation in most fungi.In addition to the above studies, it was shown that basidiocarps of Pluteus salicinus (Pluteaceae) contain the psychoactive, indole alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin, and large quantities of trehalose were isolated from M. oreades basidiocarps.

Interaction between water and solid surfaces and changes in the structural and dynamical behavior resulting from local electric fields, geometric confinement, different bonding geometries and different surface structures can substantially affect the properties of both phases in the near surface region. These interactions are of significant interest in geochemistry, materials technological and biology in cases where the aqueous phase is strongly perturbed by the surface and continuum models of the fluid fail to adequately capture surface effects. MD methods are, thus, rapidly developing as important tools for predicting and understanding the interaction of aqueous solutions with rocks, sediments, soils and other natural and synthetic materials. This thesis presents the results of a series of MD studies designed to evaluate the effects of the crystal structure, structural charge, and surface charge distribution of the substrate on ordering and local structure of near-surface water, its hydrogen bond network, diffusive dynamics and energetics. Results for brucite [Mg(OH)2], gibbsite [Al(OH)3], and hydrotalcite [Mg2Al(OH)6Cl&middot;2H2O] will illustrate these effects for hydroxide phases, and results for talc [Mg3Si 4O10(OH)2] and muscovite [KAl2(Si 3Al)O10(OH)2] those for silicates. Topics highlighted include the transition from the first layer of surface water to bulk water, interlayer hydration energetics, the low-frequency vibrational dynamics of nano-confined species, confined 2-dimensional ice and its melting, and the structure of the 10A phase (a potential water reservoir in the earth's mantle). Results are discussed in terms of computed density profiles, orientational ordering statistics, two-dimensional radial distribution functions, a tetrahedral order parameter, structural details of the H-bonding network, diffusive dynamics, and hydration energetics.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291778062", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/86526"]}, {"authors": ["Gabriel, Ana Sofia Gomes da Silva Franco"], "title": "O ensino de gen\u00e9tica e bioqu\u00edmica nas escolas: concep\u00e7\u00e3o de protocolos para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e1tica nas aulas", "description": "Mestrado em Ensino de Geologia e BiologiaA Biologia, apesar de ser uma ci\u00eancia secular, encontra-se em evolu\u00e7\u00e3o\r\nvertiginosa, sendo n\u00e3o s\u00f3 uma das ci\u00eancias que mais evoluiu no s\u00e9culo que\r\nagora terminou, como \u00e9 por vezes apontada como a que mais influenciar\u00e1 as\r\npr\u00f3ximas gera\u00e7\u00f5es.\r\nO ensino de novos campos da Biologia nas escolas \u00e9 hoje um requisito\r\nindispens\u00e1vel face aos avan\u00e7os que esta \u00e1rea do conhecimento tem vindo a\r\nsofrer nos \u00faltimos anos.

The understanding of the new subjects of Biology includes the\r\nobligatory teaching of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, because the cells\r\nas structural and functional unit of all live beings is not only limited to structural\r\nand functional characteristics, but is also on a molecular level.\r\nThe actual learning aim mainly to give a new vision putting into practice in the\r\nsecondary education, innovative laboratorial activities in current areas of\r\nBiology. Therefore the intention is to show that Molecular Biology is not\r\ncomplex and that it is possible to do innovative activities in the school\r\nlaboratories.\r\nThis research work was divided in two parts. The objectives of the first part\r\nwere to adapt/conceive, fulfil and evaluate new protocols in the area of\r\nMolecular Genetics and Biochemistry fields. In this part of the work the\r\nprotocols that were part of the learning were: \u201cExtraction of DNA of plant cells\u201d\r\nand \u201cQuantification of food proteins by Lowry\u2019s method\u201d.

Most recently, this has increased because major European Union Directives require that indicators of\r\nmarine benthic change are used to confirm good ecological status quality (as in the Water Framework Directive) and favourable\r\nconservation status (as in the Habitats and Species Directive). Furthermore, these indicators have to fit within the current\r\nphilosophy of the Ecosystem Approach requiring the development and use of Ecological Quality Objectives and Standards. Despite\r\nthis, comparisons of families of indicators derived by differing methods have not been carried out such that the robust nature of the\r\nindicators on differing spatial scales and under differing benthic conditions has not been rigorously assessed. Using case studies\r\nfrom the Portuguese coasts and estuaries, this paper compares and contrasts univariate and multivariate macrobenthic indicators to\r\nquantify comparisons of change. The studies indicate the relative value of those indicators at contrasting spatial scales, e.g. in the\r\ntransition from small areas around coastal submarine outfalls, to the local and regional estuarine and coastal scale. The analysis\r\nindicates the difficulties of deriving and using qualitative and quantitative indicators from benthic communities in stable, and in\r\nmoderately and highly variable environmental conditions in estuarine, coastal and open sea habitats. In some areas, the variability\r\nin the indicators and indices within a station and site is as large as that between stations and sites. For those areas studied, there is\r\nan adequate quality and quantity of benthic data available for making management decisions but this is unlikely to be the case for\r\nall areas. Similarly, the interrogation of the methods shows that while their use and interpretation rely on a good understanding of\r\nthe biology of the individual species and their responses to physical and polluting stress, that understanding is not yet available for\r\nmany of the species. Most notably, while the indices and integrative indicators are becoming increasingly sophisticated, many are\r\nstill dependent on the Pearson\r\n\u2013\r\nRosenberg model for organic enrichment hence they require to be validated for physical disturbance\r\nand for chemical pollution. Because of these features, the outcome of the analysis has repercussions for the management of coastal\r\nand estuarine areas. Although the present study indicates the value of indicators of benthic change for making management\r\ndecisions at the various scales, further validation is required especially, for example, where one indicator over-estimates the\r\necological status for poor areas and underestimates it for good areas", "doi": "10.1016/j.jembe.2005.12.040", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["article"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/32241945", "http://hdl.handle.net/10773/13310"]}, {"authors": ["Pestana, J.

Imidacloprid pulses reduced invertebrate abundance and community diversity in imidacloprid-dosed streams compared to control streams. These results correlated well with effects of imidacloprid on leaf litter decomposition and feeding rates of Pteronarcys comstocki, a stonefly, in artificial streams. Reductions in oxygen consumption of stoneflies exposed to imidacloprid were also observed in laboratory experiments. Our findings suggest that leaf litter degradation and single species responses can be sensitive ecotoxicological endpoints that can be used as early warning indicators and biomonitoring tools for pesticide contamination. The data generated illustrates the value of mesocosm experiments in environmental assessment and how the consideration of functional and structural endpoints of natural communities together with in situ single species bioassays can improve the evaluation and prediction of pesticide effects on stream ecosystems.

Most participants were between 18 and 21 years old (64%) and were women (78.5%). Participants were asked to self-identify their race and approximately one-third [27% (n=56)] reported their race as White, and only 10.2% (n=21) reported their race as Black. Most self-reported their skin color as a lighter shade (89% rated their skin color between 1 and 4) and 31.2% (n=64) reported their skin color as \"2=very light\". Only 10.8% (n=22) reported their skin color as 5 and above (darker skin color). Approximately one-quarter reported their parent's country of origin is Mexico 24.9% (n=51) and others reported their parent's country of origin is the United States of America (15.1% n=31), or various countries in Latin America (e.g., Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba) and European Countries (e.g., Scotland, Spain, Ireland, Hungary). More than half were single when they completed the survey (58.5%), 39% were in a relationship, and 2.9% were married. Approximately, 70% reported they spoke another language while growing up; 64.9% reported speaking Spanish. Most were in college when they completed the survey (68.8% n=141). More than half reported their annual income as less than $10,000 (n=138; 67.3%) and approximately half reported their family's social economic status as working class (43.9%). Participants first completed a demographic questionnaire and then 5 valid and reliable self-report surveys to examine their skin color, racial identity, perceived racial discrimination, parental racial socialization, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Results suggest that racial identity, specifically the self-hatred and anti-dominant stages of the cross identity stages of development, and not skin color or parental racial socialization is a significant mediator between perceived racial discrimination and self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Participants who perceived more racial discrimination and who were in the self-hatred stage tended to report more depressive symptoms (partial mediation). Results of the second mediation analysis suggest that the self-hatred and anti-dominant scales are significantly associated with lower self-esteem and is a fully mediated model because the racial discrimination path was not significant. Thus, for USA born Latinos who report experiencing racial discrimination, the more grounded in self-hatred or anti-dominant identities, the lower their self-esteem and the more depressive symptoms they tend to experience. This is a noteworthy finding which supports Cross's (1991) racial identity development. Results also suggest that parental socialization towards equality despite racial differences is a significant predictor of higher self-esteem and less depressive symptoms. This dissertation study has important implications for family therapists who are working with young adult USA born Latinos. First, more comprehensive clinical assessments should be done to better understand Latinos' experiences of racial discrimination, racial identity, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. Clinicians should focus on the importance of parental socialization toward equality, in particular when Latino youth report experiencing discrimination, depressive symptoms, and lower self-esteem. In future research studies, two or more racial identity models should be used to capture the diverse ways Latinos tend to racially identify in the USA. Studies should also be designed to prospectively evaluate the importance of racial identity development over time from childhood to young adulthood to better understand Latino mental health and well-being in order to develop culturally sensitive family prevention programs for parents and youth.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201411, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190334543.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190334543.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190334543", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6135", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6135"]}, {"authors": ["Gon\u00e7alves, C.", "Oliveira, Isabel M.", "Reis, R.

Unlike other enzymes that catalyze substrate modifications, P450s catalyze the activation of oxygen, which then reacts with the nearest substrate atom. Among the many plant P450s characterized to date, four (CYP73A5, CYP75B1, CYP84A1, CYP98A3) catalyze rate-limiting hydroxylation steps in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Homology modeling studies of the P450-substrate interactions in these four P450s have indicated that substrates bind in similar orientations and locations in all four P450s. De novo models of several bacterial and mammalian P450s, built using new alignment strategies and hybrid templates have shown that they resemble their respective crystal structures better than models developed using conventional sequence alignment strategies. With the success of these modeling predictions, virtual screening methods were developed to accelerate the process of defining functionalities for orphan P450s. In these the three-dimensional structures of compounds in metabolic pathways were docked in a number of P450 models and ranked according to the predicted protein-substrate interactions. Site-directed mutagenesis and comparative metabolism studies with CYP98A3 using its natural and alternative substrates have supported predictions on their binding modes. These experiments have clarified the structural specificity of CYP98A3 for p-coumaroyl shikimate and indicated a possible substrate access channel. Procedures have also been developed for the expression of N-terminally truncated forms of CYP98A3 and CYP73A5 suitable for x-ray crystallography. Both proteins have been used in crystallographic trials and are being processed for full-scale structural determinations. Protein expression strategies have also been developed for expression of 13C,15N-labeled full-length microsomal P450s in minimal isotopically enriched media suitable for solid state NMR analysis.

Many advantages over chemical synthesis include high selectivity and specificity, increased yield, and function under milder conditions without the need for toxic metals, organic solvents, strong acids or bases, or high pressures and temperatures. However, naturally occurring enzymatic pathways are often times not particularly well suited towards obtaining high product yield due to the organism's evolution not dependent on the production of such high levels of desired product. Xylitol is an attractive pentose sugar alcohol that has many applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and high-value based biochemical product industries. It is still, however, relatively expensive to produce, which prevents its economical integration into the marketplace. To expand the possible routes of xylitol synthesis, and provide a process which can utilize both hemicellulosic pentose sugars D-xylose and L-arabinose from renewable plant biomass as feed substrates, my thesis research focused on utilizing a fungal-derived biosynthetic pathway for production of xylitol. The pathway consists of two NADPH-dependent reductases, xylose reductase (XR) and L-xylulose reductase (LXR), and an NAD+-dependent L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (LAD). The XR enzyme converts D-xylose directly to xylitol, while the three enzyme in tandem convert L-arabinose to xylitol. However, the cofactor imbalance presented with the pathway potentially makes nicotinamide regeneration difficult for production in vivo. After cloning and characterization of a highly active and stable NAD +-dependent L-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase (LAD) from Neurospora crassa, subsequent engineering via rational design and directed evolution resulted in the isolation of the first known NADP+-dependent LAD enzyme. This novel engineered LAD was then introduced into the fungal xylitol pathway and expressed in a model organism, E. coli, and the effect of the cofactor specificity alteration was evaluated in the conversion of L-arabinose to xylitol. Further investigation of the cofactor balancing benefits were applied to xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) for full redox balancing of the initial steps of the L-arabinose pathway, and investigations of the limiting steps in L-arabinose utilization conducted in S. cerevisiae and E. coli  led to further proposed engineering of LAD.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29174319", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72139"]}, {"authors": ["Copeland, Travis Burton"], "title": "Health and human nature: A naturalist's account of health and normality", "description": "The argument between naturalists and normativists about the notions of health, normality and disease has largely revolved around the fact-value distinction and the problem of the place of values in biomedical science. In this essay it is argued that the proper place for a naturalist to begin an investigation of these notions is in biology, and that the fact-value controversy is an inappropriate focus for a naturalist investigating the semantics of health notions. A rigorous naturalist analysis of standards of organismic assessment should begin with the kinds of organismic assessment made in the biological sciences. Perhaps the most fruitful area of discussion regarding organismic assessment is the discussion among ecologists of the classification of symbioses.Three models offer themselves as frameworks for the classification of symbioses. First there is the model presented in most introductory texts in biology which classifies symbiotic relationships according to harm or benefit to the organisms in the association. Second, there is the model which more sophisticated biologists employ which classifies symbiotic relationships according to fitness effects on the organisms in the association. This second model is often taken as a refinement of the first. Finally, it is suggested that an alternative functional assessment model escapes shortcoming of each of the earlier two models.Generalization of this functional assessment of the organism in the face of varying conditions and environments rather than merely varying associations provides the groundwork for a plausible reconstruction of health and normality, with the assessment of health being simply functional assessment, and normality being the more complicated of the two notions. It is suggested that a condition of an organism is normal if it is to be predicted from among a group of alternatives from a functional analysis of the rest of the organism. What emerges from this analysis is a notion of normality which we contrast with disease and pathology and a notion of health as more than the mere absence of disease.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4832170", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/23747"]}, {"authors": ["Genthner, Barbara Sharak"], "title": "The Biology of Eubacterium Limosum and Its Utilization of One-Carbon Compounds", "description": "180 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1984.Eubacterium limosum was isolated as the most numerous methanol-utilizing anaerobe (6.3 x 10('8) cells per ml) in the rumen fluid of two sheep fed a diet in which liquid molasses was a major component.In addition to energy sources already known, E. limosum grew with methanol, H(,2)-CO(,2), CO, formate, isoleucine or valine as the energy source. Acetate was required for growth with methanol, lactate, valine, and isoleucine, but not with H(,2)-CO(,2). CO(,2) was required for growth with methanol (and H(,2)) and stimulated growth with CO.

Thus, crown ethers have become the prototypical ionophore-model systems in chemistry and biology. Insight gained by studying the interaction of crown ethers with metal ions may lead to the design and development of new ionophores that can be used for specialized purposes. The key to unraveling the selectivity trends observed in crown ether systems is to characterize and classify the various competing non-covalent interactions. Gas-phase cluster spectroscopy offers a suitable avenue to study the role that these non-covalent interactions play in metal ion crown ether systems.The major portion of this dissertation deals with studying M+ (12-crown-4 ether)(H2O)1--4 and M +(18-crown-6 ether)(H2O)1--4 systems, where M=Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs, using a combination of infrared predissociation spectroscopy and density functional theory methods. Since the ultimate goal is to model condensed-phase and physiological systems, where hydration plays a central role, special emphasis is given to studying the role of microhydration in these systems. The results indicate that as the degree of hydration is increased there is a shift away from the crown ether&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;M + and crown ether&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;H2O interactions, which dominate in systems with one water, in favor of extensive H2O&amp;middot;&amp;middot;&amp;middot;H 2O hydrogen bonding interactions. These hydrogen bonding interactions lead to broad featureless spectra that make comparison with calculation and elucidation of structure difficult. One solution to this problem is to generate the argon-tagged analogs of the hydrated species, M+(12-crown-4 ether)(H2O)1--4Ar and M+(18-crown-6ether)(H 2O)1--4Ar. Since argon-tagged species are colder than their un-tagged counterparts, their spectra have sharp, well-defined peaks which allow for comparison with calculations. While differences in the infrared spectra for the tagged and un-tagged species exist (temperature effects) for both 12-crown-4 and 18-crown-6 systems, the most interesting aspects of the argon-tagged studies is the ability to generate, trap, and detect high energy conformers in our 18-crown-6 ether experiments. Upon irradiation with an infrared photon, these high-energy conformers undergo a rearrangement to the global-minimum energy conformers and liberate the excess energy via loss of all solvating ligands.A custom electro-sonic spray ionization source has also been constructed to extend metal ion crown ether studies to systems with divalent ions. The initial study on Mn2+(18-crown-6 ether)(CH3OH) 1--3 reveals strong, charge-enhanced hydrogen bonding is present when the metal ion is a dication. Hydrogen bonds observed in the IR spectra shift by more than 500 cm-1 to lower frequency. This causes overlap between the hydrogen-bonded OH stretch of CH3OH and the CH stretching vibrations of 18-crown-6 ether. Using density functional theory calculations and deuterated studies, the experimental IR spectra are deconvoluted.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29174438", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72258"]}, {"authors": ["Reed, P.C.", "Wetzel, Mark J.", "Webb, Donald W.", "Young, T.C.", "Phillippe, Loy R."], "title": "Karst Springs in the Sinkhole Plain of Illinois: Their Community Diversity and\r\n            Hydrogeology", "description": "ID: 8297INHS Technical Report prepared for Illinois Groundwater Consortium, Research Development\r\n            and Administration, Southern Illinois University at CarbondaleU of I OnlyRestriction applied due to geolocation information of springs on private property", "publisher": "INHS Center for Biodiversity", "subjects": ["text", "Technical Report"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/4819595.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/4819595.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/4819595", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/10297"]}, {"authors": ["McRuer, Robert George"], "title": "Reading the Queer Renaissance", "description": "\"Reading the Queer Renaissance\" puts a name to the unprecedented outpouring of creative work by lesbian and gay novelists, poets, and playwrights in the 1980s and 90s, and articulates this efflorescence of queer creativity to the contemporary \"renaissance\" of radical gay and lesbian political analysis. This project thereby resists the characteristic ideological connotations carried by the term \"renaissance,\" linking it instead to contemporary writers' citation of earlier moments in the twentieth century when lesbians and gay men came together to critique the systemic oppression of homosexuality and to reshape identities across differences. Hence, this is not a renaissance at all, if renaissances are understood--as they traditionally are--as securing a \"great nation's\" cultural position through \"transcendence\" of that nation's historical location; instead, it is a queer renaissance rooted in particular communities' histories and struggles. Throughout, I analyze various queer identities enacted by some of the texts I see as central to the Queer Renaissance. My first chapter reads Audre Lorde's Zami: A New Spelling of My Name alongside Edmund White's A Boy's Own Story and considers how Zami redefines the parameters of the coming-out story in order to posit a \"self\" defined in and through others. My second chapter engages with African-American theories of signification and suggests that Randall Kenan's A Visitation of Spirits effects a queer trickster identity able to upset hierarchies of power and transform even the supposed \"margins\" of the queer world. Chapter 3 focuses on Gloria Anzaldua's Borderlands/La Frontera and argues that Anzaldua's \"new mestiza\" crosses the border not to escape identity and history, but rather, to challenge the unchecked mobility of oppressive systems of power. Finally, my fourth chapter juxtaposes Tony Kushner's Angels in America and Sarah Schulman's People in Trouble and considers how the critical aesthetic that is at play in the Queer Renaissance shapes, and has been shaped by, liminal sexual and activist \"identities in a crisis.\" In the epilogue, I conclude that the Queer Renaissance is ongoing despite, and indeed in the face of, the recent rise of gay neoconservatism and of studies seeking to ground homosexuality in biology.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4828184", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/19761"]}, {"authors": ["Redford, Glen Ivan"], "title": "Fast Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Using a Full-Field Homodyne System with Applications in Biology", "description": "A fast, full-field fluorescence lifetime imaging system based on the homodyne technique was built and used for several applications.

This dissertation study seeks to better understand diverging interpretations or narratives at play in the experiences of those facing depression by examining the language of actual survivors. In particular, the complexity of individuals' decisions regarding possible medication use is investigated. Through fourteen in-depth interviews with survivors reflecting diverse (both positive and negative) psychiatric experiences, three specific questions are explored: (1) How exactly do individuals come to adopt a particular narrative of depression and its treatment? (2) What are the most meaningful differences between varied narratives that arise? (3) After being adopted, how do particular narratives appear to be maintained over time? The first section of the report describes basic patterns across survivor accounts---first, in reviewing individual synopses of each narrative (Ch. 3), and second, in documenting key interpretive themes across all interviews (Ch. 4-5). The second section moves into more direct analyses of these narratives, taking up explicitly the three empirical questions in turn. Chapter 6 identifies multiple resources that individuals draw upon in the adoption of distinct treatment narratives (e.g., intense levels of confusion and urgency; comments from friends/family; drug effects). Ensuing moments are proposed as powerfully cementing and galvanizing specific interpretations of both depression and associated medication use. Chapter 7 explores several issues underlying some of the most meaningful differences between narratives (how participants interpret the role of biology, agency, medication and surrounding relationships). In Chapter 8, strategies that appear to be associated with the maintenance of particular treatment narratives are examined. Among other things, analysis of patterns across accounts points to a striking role for diverging narratives in the unfolding treatment experiences of those facing depression. Since such individuals typically have little awareness that their treatment experience can be interpreted in fundamentally different ways---nor that these distinctions may have substantial implications for how their experience ultimately unfolds---a more thoughtful and broad-based deliberation involving both professionals and those facing depression is subsequently proposed.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158305221", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/82175"]}, {"authors": ["Samson, Karen Margolis"], "title": "An Instructional Strategy for Helping Readers Identify the Gist in Expository Text", "description": "247 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1982.The objective of this two-week instructional study was to improve high school students' comprehension of biology text materials through use of an explicit instructional strategy. The Topic/Subtopic Strategy is a two-step procedure designed to enable readers to recognize relationships among key ideas in text by engaging readers in the active process of evaluating and synthesizing text segments. The Strategy emerged in the attempt to create a practical tool for helping readers discriminate between more important and less important ideas represented in text.The Topic/Subtopic Strategy requires readers in Step One to first analyze sentences in terms of TOPIC (what the sentence is about) and COMMENT (what is being said about the topic). Step Two involves grouping Topic/Comment elements according to relationship types in order to create important subtopics suggested by relevant information. In teaching this Strategy, the experimenter was interested in examining the extent to which Strategy instruction would affect readers' comprehension of gist information. Comprehension of gist was measured by recall and short-answer questions. While the Strategy group received instruction, a second treatment group, the Read-Study group, practiced reading, studying (using any method), and recalling information. Both the Strategy group and the Read-Study group used the same text passages. A Control group received regular classroom instruction.Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the data. This procedure enabled the experimenter to evaluate the unique effect of treatment both in isolation and as a function of various status variables. Findings suggest that the positive effects of Strategy learning on gist recall were limited to contextually-bound situations. In other words, evidence suggests that the Strategy may be effective for certain students under certain conditions. Overall main effects favoring Strategy effectiveness were found for the biology mid-test Passage 2 (on recall of secondary important propositions and question score). Significant interactions favoring the effectiveness of the Strategy varied across specific contextually-bound situations. In summary, results suggest that instruction in gist identification has a contextually-specific effect.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29171009", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/68810"]}, {"authors": ["Neway, Julie Marlaine"], "title": "The Role of The Information Specialist as an Active Team Member in Academic Research", "description": "348 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1982.The major goal of this research was to investigate the role of the information specialist as an active team member in an academic scientific research setting.

The plant communities of this ecosystem are relatively well known and appreciated, but little is known of the biology of most insects that are endemic to prairie ecosystems of North America, with the exception of large and conspicuous species. In particular, species that are sequestered within plant tissues are commonly overlooked. With my research, I characterized the community of insect species that inhabit flowering stems of Silphium laciniatum L. and  S. terebinthinaceum Jacquin. I used stable isotope analysis to clarify the trophic position of several of the key members of the community, determining that the only beetle in the system is a facultative predator.

Due to these procedures involving the shoulder, it is not surprising that some women experience shoulder complex motion and coordination problems. However, the long-term effect that BC treatments have on shoulder complex motion and coordination during functional tasks is not well understood.  The rationale for impaired shoulder complex motion and coordination among women with BC is that these women frequently experience impairments that are believed to contribute to these problems including soft tissue pain, decreased shoulder complex muscle strength, decreased tissue flexibility, altered resting scapular alignment (RSA), and lymphedema. However, limited research exists to support this notion. Therefore, the aims of this dissertation were 1) determine the effect that breast cancer treatments (LR and MR) have on shoulder complex motion and coordination, 2) identify clinical factors associated with impaired shoulder complex coordination in women with a history of breast cancer treatment.  Scapular and humeral kinematic data and clinical measures of pain, RSA, tissue flexibility, strength and lymphedema were collected on 30 women with BC (mean age \u00b1 SD = 53.8 \u00b1 10.9 yrs.) and 30 women without BC (mean age \u00b1 SD = 52.7 \u00b1 10.8 yrs.). Separate one-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were conducted to determine whether differences in shoulder complex motion existed between groups (p < .05). Angle-angle and relative motion graphs were created for 3 scapular and 2 clavicular rotations. Mean curves with 95% minimal detectable change bands (MDCB) were calculated using data from women without BC. Each woman with BC\u2019s curve was individually compared to the mean curve and MDCB. Women with BC were classified as having normal (curve fell within MDCB) or impaired shoulder complex coordination (curve fell outside MDCB).  Discriminant analyses were used to identify clinical variables that could classify women as having normal or impaired shoulder complex coordination (p < .05).  There were no significant differences in shoulder complex motion between women with and without BC or between those with different medical management (LR, MR). Over 93% of women with BC demonstrated impaired shoulder complex coordination for at least 1 scapular or clavicular rotation. Discriminant analysis revealed that clinical measures of pain, RSA, tissue flexibility, strength, and lymphedema were associated with impaired shoulder complex coordination.  Cross-validated classification showed that 43.4% to 73.3% of women were grouped correctly.  Failure to find group differences in motion may be due to the fact that women in our study were relatively high functioning and recovered from their medical management.  Additionally, the majority of women in our study were previously educated on a home exercise program (73.3%) and attended physical therapy (56.7%). A lack of significant differences in shoulder complex motion between women with and without a BC suggests that the women in our study had sufficient range of motion to accomplish the functional tasks. Although we did not find differences in motion between women with and without BC across functional tasks, the majority women with BC demonstrated impaired shoulder complex coordination. Clinical measures of tissue flexibility (ROM and pectoralis minor length) were associated with impaired shoulder complex coordination across multiple scapular and clavicular rotations.Ph.D., Rehabilitation Sciences -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201512, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190328839.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190328839.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190328839", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6684", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6684"]}, {"authors": ["Enuameh, Yeetey Akpe Kwesi"], "title": "Transforming the System of Care for Adolescents in Ghana: Preliminary Investigation of Adolescent Friendly Health Services Implementation in Two Administrative Districts of the Ghana Health Service", "description": "Background -- The younger generation is the wealth and future of humanity; their health and wellbeing deserve utmost attention. Adolescent Friendly Health Services (AFHS) aim at providing accessible, developmentally appropriate and comprehensive evidence based promotional, preventive, therapeutic, and rehabilitative health care to adolescents via well trained professionals and well equipped health facilities. This study sought to explore adherence of health facilities in Ghana to the World Health Organization (WHO) AFHS concept. The study also identified obstacles the facilities faced in implementing the program, innovative measures taken to overcome them and any other approaches to enhance AFHS delivery to the adolescent population. Methods -- Using a cross sectional (observational) study design with a multi informant, mixed method survey, the study assessed adherence to AFHS criteria among health facilities providing AFHS oriented care in the Akwapim North and South Districts of Ghana. Results -- Health facilities identified as early adopters had significantly higher AFHS implementation compared to late adopters, and the association of adopter category with AFHS implementation did not vary by location (urban vs. rural). Organizational characteristics of clinical care infrastructure, logistics monitoring, and capacity building, were significantly associated with implementation. Major barriers to AFHS implementation included care provider attitude/behavior towards adolescents, community attitudes about adolescents receiving sexual and reproductive health services like family planning, and health care costs (affecting adolescents and health facilities). Conclusions -- The Ghana Ministry of Health initiative to transform the system towards AFHS appears to be successful, as early adopters have higher rates of implementation than late adopters, but it is important to note that a transformation of this nature takes time. The change towards AFHS implementation is supported by organizational changes to clinical care infrastructure, logistics monitoring, and capacity building, suggesting that the addition of a training and technical assistance program may speed the change process. Finally, while facility structure and process issues are important for transforming the Ghana Healthy System towards AFHS, it appears that successful transformation also depends, in part, upon provider and community attitudes, available resources for work, and health care policies related to costs, highlighting the importance of working with health care professional organizations, community leaders, and other stakeholders to institute full system-wide change.Dr.P.H., Public Health -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201305, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190330699.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190330699.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190330699", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6131", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6131"]}, {"authors": ["Mohamad Baba, Zeinab"], "title": "Examining Disparities in Breast Cancer Screening Rates in a Program Designed to Provide Free Care to Women in the State of Pennsylvania", "description": "Background. Female breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women and the second leading cause of cancer death in women (behind lung cancer) (U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group, 2013b). The purpose of this research was to examine client and provider level characteristics driving the disparities in morbidity and mortality as it relates to breast cancer screening, thus providing a clear indication of what client and provider factors are essential for successfully reducing disparities in breast cancer screening beyond removing barriers of cost. Specific aims include: (1) To characterize the client population utilizing the services of the Healthy Woman Program in Pennsylvania; (2) To Identify client and provider predictive factors that influence women with an initial screening mammogram to return for rescreening within 24 months; and (3) To use a local case study to explore service delivery factors influencing woman with an initial screening mammogram to return for rescreening. Methods. This study was a retrospective analysis of prospective data from the Healthy Woman Program (HWP), investigating women enrolled in the HWP in Pennsylvania and their rescreening rates. As the HWP dataset primarily contained client-level variables, additional structural provider-level variables were derived from Komen Foundation data, and data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Census, to extend the investigation beyond the individual woman to specified contextual effects. A local qualitative case study augmented the quantitative analysis to explore more process-oriented contextual effects, with an emphasis on how services are organized to support client outreach and retention, and promising practices for getting clients to return for rescreening. Results. The major predictors of an abnormal mammogram were having a diagnostic mammogram rather than a screening mammogram, being younger than 40, and living in an urban area. The major predictors of a breast cancer diagnosis were being white, being younger than 40, living in a large rural town, and being a current smoker. The major predictors of dropping out after an abnormal mammogram were being white, and having a diagnostic mammogram rather than a screening mammogram. The major predictors of delay in diagnostic work up were Black race and screening mammogram. The major predictors of returning for screening were living in a large rural town, being a non-smoker, having no symptoms prior to the initial mammogram, having a normal result from the initial mammogram, and living with others. Comprehensive breast cancer education, delivered in community settings, and tailored to cultural, social, and literacy issues, results in a robust referral network. More reminders than mandated by HWP Guidance, through multiple channels, rather than the client alone, increase returns for annual rescreening. Conclusions. Prior investigation of rescreening rates among low-income women has focused on client-level factors, yielding a narrow range of targets for systems change. This study investigated both client and provider level characteristics, analyzing them together and separately, to increase understanding of the multifactorial predictors of rescreening and widen the set of potential targets for change. Instituting a protocol of allowing community groups to organize a few women to have screenings in one day and allowing for interpreters who are family or community members would improve rescreening rates. Methods for ensuring patients return should be modified as the HWP sequence may not be enough.Dr.P.H., Public Health -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201405, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190326292.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190326292.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190326292", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6724", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6724"]}, {"authors": ["Johnson, Kristen Melissa"], "title": "Epidemiology of HIV-1 and hepatitis virus co-infection: Distribution and pathogenesis in an urban clinic population", "description": "Given similar routes of exposure, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is common among HIV-positive populations. The long-term impact of these is becoming an important public health concern, given the high rates of co-exposure coupled with increased AIDS-related survival and widespread accessibility of antiretroviral therapy. Using a population drawn from an urban HIV clinic, we investigated prevalence rates of co-exposure, and identified factors associated with co-exposure, sexual transmission of HCV, and HCV viral clearance using a cross-sectional study design on data collected from 2002-11. We also conducted survival analyses using Cox proportional hazards regressions to model the risk of progression to four outcomes (clinical AIDS, all-cause mortality, HIV virologic failure, and decline in CD4 count) based on HBV and HCV status.  Among 2,880 HIV-positive subjects, relatively high seroprevalences of HBV (44%), HCV (34%), and HBV/HCV (19%) was observed. Injection drug users (IDUs) had the greatest odds of each co-exposure. Additionally, race, sex, socioeconomic status, older age, and more recent HIV diagnosis were associated with co-exposure. Sexual transmission of HCV was associated with Black race, younger age, and a more recent HIV diagnosis Among subjects with a history of HCV exposure, 13% had evidence of HCV viral clearance; being HBV surface antigen-positive was highly predictive of clearance. In the survival analysis, HBV status negatively affected HIV disease progression, particularly time to clinical AIDS and HIV virologic failure. Additionally, HCV status may be related to faster progression to clinical AIDS and all-cause mortality.  Taken together, our findings highlight the burden of viral hepatitis co-infections among HIV-positive individuals, and the need to reduce this burden through routine testing, HBV vaccination, and appropriate therapy. Further research, particularly with a prospective study design, is warranted to fully understand the factors associated with viral hepatitis co-infection among HIV-positive populations. Identification of those more likely to develop chronic HCV infections can inform therapy decisions. Further, given the relatively high rates of HBV and HCV co-infection and the current debate on their impact on HIV disease progression, additional research is needed to further elucidate these relationships.Ph.D., Epidemiology -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201212, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322483.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322483.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322483", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6729", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6729"]}, {"authors": ["Chilton, Gioia Connell"], "title": "An Arts-Based Study of the Dynamics of Expressing Positive Emotions within the Intersubjective Art Making Process", "description": "This arts-based research study explored the dynamics of expressing positive emotions, within the intersubjective art making process. The study addressed a multifaceted problem involving a gap in knowledge about the process of emotional expression through art making, which is key to therapeutic action in art therapy. The design was arts-based research, as art making was the primary means of inquiry. The philosophy and methodology of arts-based research were employed to explore the emotional aspects of intersubjective experience. Following the traditions of arts based research, the meaning-making capacity of creating art was used to illuminate the process of artistic creation in response to the research questions. The research was conducted following approval by the Drexel University IRB. Five English-speaking adults who were professional art therapists were recruited as key informants. The method of data generation involved an initial two hour Art Interview, followed by reflexive memoing and responsive art-making by the researcher and a subsequent second Art Interview with co-researchers. Methodological credibility procedures consisted of member checking and peer review. The data analysis processes involved: 1) traditional use of qualitative data analysis practices, such as the use of MAXQDA-10 software for coding for themes and 2) arts-based research data analysis methods. The analysis of the interview data, artistic data, artistic responses and a creative synthesis addressed the research question in the form of visual art pieces, poetry, a video, three stories, four themes, and a theoretical model. Overall, the verbal and artistic analysis of the data resulted in thematic categories that represent the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective art therapy relationship. Based upon the findings, the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective context was conceptualized as an iterative process beginning with metaphors of life and nature, the development of trust, revelations of emotion, empathic responses, reflexivity and joint artmaking creating and causing destabilization, deconstruction, reconstruction, and reimagining of perceptions and meanings. An emerging, holistic view of emotions and the transformative capacity of artmaking in a context of relational trust were discussed. Clinical applications included consideration of the therapeutic use of response art and joint artmaking. The limitations of the study were also described, as was methodological criteria for arts-based research. Overall, this expanding discourse helped to identify ways art therapy works. The study achieved its aim by contributing knowledge to our understanding of how emotions emerge, are expressed, and assigned meaning within an art therapy relational context.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201403, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190332626.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190332626.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190332626", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6128", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6128"]}, {"authors": ["Cohen, Chari A."], "title": "Chronic HBV Infection and Community\u2010Based Services for High\u2010Risk Asians and Pacific Islanders", "description": "Chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and results in considerable health disparities for Asians and Pacific Islander Americans (APIs). There are still multiple knowledge gaps regarding HBV in APIs, including information on factors associated with HBV infection and immunity in foreign\u2010born APIs. Particularly in Philadelphia, the epidemiological landscape of chronic HBV infection in high\u2010risk API communities remains largely unknown, making it difficult to develop appropriately targeted interventions. Community\u2010based screening and linkage to care can play an important role in improving low HBV diagnosis rates and generating a more complete understanding of HBV infection in high\u2010risk ethnic communities. However, there are no recommended strategies for addressing HBV infection at the community level, which has limited the success of community\u2010based programs throughout the U.S. This project used a mixed\u2010methods approach to: determine the factors associated with HBV infection and protection (immunity) among APIs in Philadelphia who participated in community\u2010based screening; and to understand the processes, challenges and strategies for conducting enhanced community\u2010based screening and linkage to care. The study included quantitative analysis of survey and seroprevalence data from 2,047 foreign\u2010born and 2nd generation APIs residing in Philadelphia; and qualitative analysis of narratives, focus groups and interviews from two sites that conducted enhanced community\u2010based HBV programming. Controlling for all other variables (at p<0.5), infected individuals in the sample tended to be male, between the ages of 18\u201029, disclosed that they had been previously tested for HBV, had a high school diploma or less, and had either a family member with HBV or HCC, or lived with an infected person; protected individuals in the sample tended to be between the ages of 18\u201029 and born in Korea; susceptible individuals tended to be over age 55, with no family history of HBV, no previous HBV test, and born in a country with no (or a limited) national HBV vaccine program. Not controlling for other variables, being born in China was significantly associated with being linked to care. Results of the qualitative analysis revealed that having a diverse community stakeholder committee was important to the success of enhanced community\u2010based HBV programming. Including stakeholders in all planning stages, and offering ongoing opportunities for training and relationship development helped maintain stakeholder engagement. Limited time, funding, HBV knowledge, bi\u2010lingual resources, and a lack of language capable free health clinics served as challenges to HBV screening, vaccination and linkage to care. Service integration, advanced planning, and having an understanding of community needs were identified strategies to improve programmatic outcomes. Identified challenges with data collection included length of the survey instrument, as well as limited staff time and training needs. The results of this project can be used to guide future community\u2010based interventions in Philadelphia and around the U.S., to successfully improve HBV\u2010related screening, vaccination and linkage to care for high\u2010risk and infected API communities.Dr.P.H., Community Health and Prevention -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201504, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322199.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322199.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322199", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6304", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6304"]}, {"authors": ["Awosan, Christiana Ibilola"], "title": "Never Married Heterosexual Black Male-Female Intimate Romantic Experiences: A Phenomenological Study", "description": "The diminishing rates of marriage and proliferation of individuals who are unmarried in the United States have greatly altered the makeup of heterosexual intimate pair bonding in the general population. For Blacks in the United States, these circumstances are more profound. Over the past decades, the precipitous decline in Black marriages and the salient upsurge of never married Blacks have stimulated much theoretical focus but few empirical research studies on Black adults' heterosexual coupling unions have been undertaken (Camp, 2002; Dixon, 2009; Pinderhughes, 2002; Tucker, 2003). In order to fill the empirical gaps regarding heterosexual coupling unions among Blacks, this qualitative hermeneutic phenomenological study explored the experiences of 26 never married Black men and women (ages 25-35) in their attempts to cultivate and maintain intimate romantic relationships. Through in-depth, open-ended individual interview approach, this phenomenological study, guided with the theoretical frameworks of Africana Womanism (Hudson-Weems, 2008) and Symbolic Interactionism (Charon, 2007), sought to capture and understand how participants described and interpreted their intimate romantic coupling experiences and relationships. The findings illustrated that the overwhelming majority of the participants desired to be married or be involved in a long-term secure and intimate romantic relationship. The majority of the participants felt that the initial stage of cultivating romantic relationships began with strong unspoken connection and passion because of their common Black racial identity, background and culture. Furthermore, participants expressed that their racial location and history in society also contributed to the difficulties that they experienced in maintaining an intimate romantic relationship. Participants contextualized their experiences of cultivating and maintaining intimate romantic relationships within social-historical context of the imposition of whiteness, the residual effects of slavery around skin color and emotional alienation between Black men and women; socio-cultural context of the rarity of long-term, positive quality Black marriages and relationships as well as internalized racial stereotypes; and socio-structural context of gender imbalance in educational, income and career achievements. The findings illustrated that as a result of pairing within these socio-historical, socio-cultural and socio-structural contexts, never married heterosexual Black men and women appeared to be coupling within a shame-based racial context. Participants, therefore, described their experienced coupling processes to be difficult and labor intensive. Given these revealing findings, implications for future research, clinical training and practice, and social policy are provided.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201405, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325411.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190325411.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190325411", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6124", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6124"]}, {"authors": ["Kabadi, Shaum Mohan"], "title": "Association Between Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentration And Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Interaction By Race/Ethnicity And Mediation By Inflammation", "description": "Diabetes mellitus affects 25.6 million adults and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. Recent evidence indicates that vitamin D may alter glucose metabolism, which suggests it may play a role in reducing risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Although observational studies support pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance as pathways by which vitamin D influences glucose homeostasis, a mechanism involving systemic inflammation remains obscure. We hypothesized that vitamin D was associated with inflammation, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes. In the present investigation, we analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 2001-2006 among adults over 20 years of age. We evaluated the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], a serum biomarker of vitamin D status, and prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. In addition, we assessed the association by subgroups of gender and race/ethnicity and evaluated interaction using joint effects. We determined the association between 25(OH)D and three biomarkers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), and further assessed mediation by CRP on the association between 25(OH)D and hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], a biomarker of glucose homeostasis. Using piecewise regression, it was determined that 25(OH)D was inversely associated with CRP when 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL, but directly associated when 25(OH)D \u2265 20 ng/mL. There was significant interaction by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and abdominal obesity. Furthermore, 25(OH)D was not associated with fibrinogen but inversely associated with homocysteine. Results from path analysis indicate that CRP mediated 14.9% of the association between 25(OH)D and HbA1c in males. We determined that 25(OH)D sufficiency was associated with type 2 diabetes. However, the association was not significant in non-Hispanic Blacks which suggests that 25(OH)D sufficiency as defined by the Institute of Medicine may be inadequate for this subgroup. Our finding that vitamin D may prevent diabetes is consistent with prospective studies which supports a temporal association. Although these findings need to be confirmed in prospective studies and intervention trials, our results may be of large public health value in controlling the current unfavorable diabetes epidemic.Ph.D., Epidemiology -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201206, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322451.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322451.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322451", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6727", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6727"]}, {"authors": ["Finkelstein, Marlee A."], "title": "Determining the Efficacy of a Nutrition Education Intervention on Improving Consumer Comprehension of the Nutrition Label", "description": "Nutrition-related health problems and diseases have become a major concern in recent years.

There is a pressing need to develop new models to study cancer in an animal that is genetically, anatomically, and physiologically more analogous to humans and that metabolizes drugs and undergoes tumorigenesis similar to humans. Differences between mice, the most commonly used cancer biology model, and humans limit their utility for the study of the underlying causes of specific cancers and in the development of preclinical therapeutics for the treatment of this disease, thereby preventing the transition from basic to clinical research. Towards this end, a genetically malleable, large animal solid tumor and T-cell lymphoma models utilizing the pig was developed. Primary porcine cells were genetically engineered to be tumorigenic through the altered expression of proteins known to disrupt pathways commonly affected in human cancers. The transformed porcine cells were returned to the isogenic host animal and produced solid tumors at the site of injection. To test the hypothesis that this approach could be used to induce tumorigenesis in cells derived from each of the three embryonic germ layers, isolated porcine ectodermic fibroblasts and endodermic keratinocytes were transformed using this method. This approach was then adapted to induce the transformation of T-cells, derived from the mesoderm, in vivo. The ability to transform various cell types derived from all three embryonic layers and rapidly generate genetically defined tumors similar to those treated clinically in humans may provide a robust model for preclinical studies of adjunct cancer therapies.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158306670", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/83624"]}, {"authors": ["Dong, Rui"], "title": "Microfluidic Devices for Bioanalytical Applications", "description": "161 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) based microfluidic devices have a wide range of applications in chemistry, biology, environmental science and drug delivery.

This thesis analyzes transcription systems in Archaea and Eucarya in an effort to understand the evolution of this fundamental cellular process. Projects span from analyses of the archaeal RNA polymerase to a unique genome survey of transcription components in an early-diverging eukaryote. It is apparent that the evolution of transcriptional machinery can be subdivided into the evolution of a core system and the evolution of a peripheral set of factors modulating the activity and specificity of the core. We see the core in the similarity of RNA polymerases and modes of initiation between Archaea and Eucarya; through protein-protein interaction studies, we demonstrated that the RNA polymerases from each domain adopt a similar architecture. We see the periphery in an analysis of the genome of Giardia lamblia, highlighting the divergence of transcription systems during the early evolution of Eucarya. During the survey, the TATA-binding protein (TBP) from Giardia lamblia was observed to be highly degenerate relative to all known TBPs. Comparative modeling of giardial TBP with eukaryotic TBP crystal structures reveals altered binding surfaces for interactions with DNA and transcription factors. A comparative analysis of post-transcriptional modification of RNA in the three domains of life illustrates the uniqueness of each domain. It is likely that Archaea do not modify RNA by post-transcriptional polyadenylation, a process adopted for disparate functions in both the bacterial and eukaryal domains.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158309678", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/86633"]}, {"authors": ["Veysey, John Joseph"], "title": "Complex Fluid Dynamics: From Laminar to Geophysical Flows", "description": "In this dissertation, we present analytical, experimental, and numerical work relating to two problems in fluid flow. We first treat the oldest, hardest, and arguably one of the most important problems in boundary layer theory: determining the drag on a sphere and an infinite cylinder moving at a fixed speed in a highly viscous fluid. We necessarily extensively review previous experimental and theoretical work, and then apply techniques based on the perturbative renormalization group to produce optimal \u201ccoarse-grained\u201d approximations. These approximations lead to a new prediction for the drag coefficient, one which both reproduces and surpasses the results of matched asymptotics. We next present investigations into the biocomplex system at Yellowstone National Park. This research, which includes field work, experimental measurements, and numerical modelling, has shown that microbes do not play an important role in the formation of large scale carbonate terraces. Although we found that microbial communities are highly correlated with depositional facies, we demonstrated that this is a consequence of tight correlations between aqueous chemistry and the underlying travertine. We show how these correlations can be used to reconstruct ancient depositional environments. We also present highly successful minimal models which explain the formation of depositional facies and large scale travertine motifs, including the characteristic terrace architecture found at carbonate hot springs. Our numerical model predicts dynamical phenomena which are seen at real hot springs. It also produces patterns which have the same static statistical properties as those seen at real hot springs, and indicates that hot spring terraces are indeed scale invariant; we show that the distribution of pond\r\nareas in both simulated landscapes and real hot springs obeys the same power law.\r\nBy analogy with studies of vicinal surfaces, we identify another universal statistical characterization, the terrace width distribution. We present evidence from both simulated landscapes and experimental data that this distribution is a universal property of carbonate terraces, applying regardless of the details of local chemistry and biology.\r\nivU of I OnlyPublisher has not yet granted open access permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text", "dissertation/thesis"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291730099", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/35208"]}, {"authors": ["Steckel, Lawrence Edward"], "title": "Biology, Ecology and Management of Common Waterhemp", "description": "110 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2003.These studies focused on examining the biology and ecology of common waterhemp. This research evaluates the effect shade may have on common waterhemp growth and seed production, what effect row spacing may have on common waterhemp, crop and tillage effects on common waterhemp, and construction of a non-linear model to help predict when management should be implemented. Plant biomass and seed production decreased as shade levels were increased to 40, 68 and 99%. Common waterhemp plants responded to reduced irradiance by increasing leaf area ratios and decreasing relative growth rates. Common waterhemp emergence over the course of the growing season was closely associated with hydrothermal time within each year. In the years 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 the percent of the original common waterhemp seed bank that remained in the tilled treatments was 40%, 31%, 10% and <1% respectively. No-tilled treatments showed more reduction in the number of seeds remaining than tilled treatments in the top 0--6 cm of the soil profile. Common waterhemp seed had the longest duration of emergence under no-tilled followed by tilled treatments in 1997. Common waterhemp from 1998 through 2001 needed less than half the hydrothermal time to reach 50% emergence than in 1997. Season-long common waterhemp interference reduced corn grain yield by 74% in two years of the study and 11% in the third. Common waterhemp that emerged at the V4 corn growth stage and competed until corn maturity reduced corn grain yield by 59% in two years of the study and 13% in the third. The effect of timing of common waterhemp emergence in relation to soybean yield was described using an exponential decline model. Yield loss decreased at a faster rate for the 19-cm row spacing than the 76cm row spacing as common waterhemp emergence was delayed. Common waterhemp that emerged after the V4--V5 and R1--R2 soybean growth stages did not reduce soybean yield in the 19-cm and 76-cm row spacing, respectively.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291776547", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/85010"]}, {"authors": ["Dali, Razak Bin"], "title": "Analysis of form four chemistry and biology textbooks written in Malay with recommendations for reading instructional practices", "description": "The purposes of this study are (a) to present reasons why teaching reading and learning to read are major issues in Malaysian secondary science classes, (b) to analyze systematically the relevant facts and characteristics of secondary school science textbooks, and (c) to present suggestions on instructional practices in content area (science) reading for Malaysian secondary science classes.

The objectives of the study focused on the impact and acceptance of the information specialist and were measured in terms of the information provided, changes in the scientists' information habits, and their evaluation of the service.The case study involved sixty-seven scientists in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The information specialist attended weekly lab meetings for thirty-nine scientists, who formed the experimental group, and answered any information requests that they had during the ten month period from January to October, 1981. The remaining twenty-eight scientists served as a control group.As a result of the services which the information specialist provided, the scientists in the experimental group spent less time reading the literature and less time in discussion with their lab colleagues. They skimmed fewer articles but read more articles in-depth. A strong personal file collection had supplanted the Biology Library as the first location consulted when they needed a formal source of information. The information specialist had alerted the scientists to new journal titles and to the capabilities of the online computer search as a mechanism to provide information relevant to their work.As a communication source, the information specialist was rated very accessible and easy to use. The information which was provided gave the scientists more time to spend with their research, identified pertinent material which they would not otherwise have found, and was a very easy way to investigate a new research topic.The major value of this research was that it showed that an information specialist is able to successfully identify and satisfy information needs on a one-to-one basis.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in contrast, offer data on the motion of biomolecules with very high spatial and temporal resolution, and allow easy manipulation of the biomolecules and their environment to test the effects of perturbations such as mutations. MD simulations are limited, however, both in the timescales that they can access (usually on the order of nanoseconds) and by the accuracy of MD potential energy functions and parameters. This thesis presents a series of applications of MD to systems which are generally beyond the reach of such simulations, through a combination of force (the application of supercomputing resources) and finesse (the use of coarse graining methods). The applications include all-atom simulations of the mechanism of light detection by plant phototropins, the folding process of the WW domain and villin headpiece, the assembly and stability of a variety of viral capsids, the assembly and disassembly of high density lipoprotein particles, and the rotation of the bacterial flagellum. In each case, molecular dynamics simulations provided qualitatively new insights that are in line with previous, contemporary or subsequent experiments. In addition to exploring how molecular dynamics simulations can be extended to longer time and length scales, several of the all-atom simulations suggested avenues for improvement in modern MD force fields, and the coarse graining work lead to the development of novel methods to simulate proteins using reduced representations.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291765909", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72399"]}, {"authors": ["Myers, Randy Allen"], "title": "Effects of Reduced Irradiance on the Biology of Eastern Black Nightshade (Solanum Ptycanthum)", "description": "95 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1986.Eastern black nightshade (Solanum ptycanthum Dun.) is problematic in soybean  Glycine max (L.) Merr.  fields because of its unique ability to survive in the shaded environment under the soybean canopy. These studies were conducted to investigate the effects of shade and soybean interference on plant growth and development, berry production, and seed formation of eastern black nightshade. Increasing interference from soybeans by decreasing the soybean row width, delaying emergence until after the soybean canopy had closed, and restricting escapes to the intrarow spaces reduced the plant growth and berry production of this weed. The largest eastern black nightshade plants that were harvested were positioned between the 75-cm soybean rows and emerged with the soybean seedlings. They produced 264 berries and a plant dry weight of 43 g. The smallest plants that were harvested had a plant dry weight of less than one gram and less than one berry per plant. These plants were positioned in the 32.5-cm soybean rows and emerged 6 weeks after the soybeans had emerged. In a study to determine the effects of shade alone, in the absence of other interference factors, eastern black nightshade plant growth and berry production was also reduced by increasing levels of artificially produced shade and decreasing the length of the growing season that these plants were given at these shade levels. Plants grown without shade had dry weights of 243 g with almost 6000 berries if given a 20 week growing season, but if grown in 6% of full solar radiation plants produced only 23 berries with a dry weight of 3g. High levels of shade had the added effect of slowing the rate of increase of seed weight as the seeds developed in the eastern black nightshade berries. This increased the amount of time after anthesis needed for viable seed production. Adaptation of eastern black nightshade to increased shade was compared with other species (common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.), tumble pigweed (Amaranthus albus L.) and soybean) to determine the characteristics that eastern black nightshade possesses that enable it to be shade-tolerant. For plants grown at the lowest level of available photosynthetic photon flux density, eastern black nightshade had the lowest respiration rate, the lowest root-to-shoot ratio, the lowest leaf density, and the highest leaf area ratio, indicating that it is the most shade-tolerant of the species studied.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291765154", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/71625"]}, {"authors": ["Banerjee, Amal Chandra"], "title": "The Biology of Crambus Trisectus, Walker, in Illinois and Notes on Related Species", "description": "214 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1966.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291754949", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/61358"]}, {"authors": ["Roegge, Chris Alan"], "title": "Effects of Biological Principles Integration on Achievement and Attitudes of Secondary Agriculture Students", "description": "219 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well instruction in agriculture and in biology could be integrated in a high school agriculture setting. This purpose was accomplished by testing the effect of the incorporation of biological principles instruction into a problem area in vocational agriculture on student achievement in agriculture and in applied biology. The effect of this incorporation on student attitudes was also measured.Methods. The population for this study consisted of all students in production vocational agriculture programs in Illinois. One hundred and four students from nine schools comprised the sample, 47 in the treatment group and 57 in the control group. Since random assignment of students to treatment groups was impossible, a quasi-experimental design was used. Treatments were randomly assigned to classes. A pretest was administered prior to the beginning of instruction, and a posttest and student attitude instruments were administered immediately following the completion of instruction. Pretest scores, student background categories, previous biology experience categories, post graduation plans, and attitudes toward agriculture were used as covariate measures to control for possible pretreatment group achievement differences. Data were analyzed by means of analysis of variance and covariance, t-tests, and correlational and descriptive statistics.Findings. (1) The overall achievement mean of students taught using the integrated approach was significantly higher than that of those taught using the traditional approach (p $&lt;$.01). (2) The applied biology achievement mean of students taught using the integrated approach was significantly higher than that of those taught using the traditional approach (p $&lt;$.01). (3) There were significant relationships between student achievement and background (r = $-.15$), previous biology experience (r =.41) and post graduation plans (r =.21). (4) There were significant differences in both overall achievement and in applied biology achievement between students from farm, rural nonfarm, and urban backgrounds (p $&lt;$.05).

Despite the attention given to and the controversy engendered by the biology of these flies, both by applied entomologists concerned with the flies' status as agricultural pests and by evolutionary biologists interested in modes of speciation, this is the first study to provide substantial support for genetic differentiation for traits important in host selection and in maintenance of reproductive isolation among these sibling species and host-associated populations.Interspecific or interpopulational crosses have demonstrated three levels of partial barriers to hybridization. First, a measure of temporal isolation among host-associated populations is afforded by genetic control of seasonal divergence in post-diapause eclosion patterns. Second, the combined effects of the use of (a) the host plant as a rendezvous site for mating and (b) genetic differences among these flies for oviposition response to actual host fruits and to artificial fruits of different sizes limit the opportunity for encounter between flies from different populations. Third, even if interspecific encounters occur, differences in mating response and egg hatch success further reduce the potential for introgression.It is essential to emphasize that, while these factors must be important in maintaining reproductive isolation among these sibling species or host-associated populations of the R. pomonella group, it should not be concluded from this study that these factors were responsible for the divergence and subsequent speciation. Therefore, these results should not be construed as evidence in direct support of the hypothesis of sympatric speciation by these host-associated fruit flies.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291764631", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/71102"]}, {"authors": ["Schoknecht, Jean Ann Donze"], "title": "The Taxonomy and Biology of Whetzelinia Silvicola", "description": "121 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1972.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291758490", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/64909"]}, {"authors": ["Morden, Robert Dean"], "title": "Biology of the Evergreen Bagworm, Thyridopteryx Ephemeraeformis", "description": "85 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1971.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291758260", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/64679"]}, {"authors": ["Cheng, Georgina"], "title": "Cellular and Molecular Biological Investigations Into the Interaction Between Candida Albicans and the Vaginal Epithelium", "description": "162 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.Vaginal candidiasis affects approximately 75% of all women.  Candida albicans is the etiological agent in over 80% of vaginal candidiasis cases. Attributes of both C. albicans and the host contribute to development of vaginal candidiasis. The studies presented in this dissertation used two different experimental approaches to assess the effect of the host vaginal environment on the cellular and molecular biology of C. albicans. The first approach evaluated the expression of the eight agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) genes in clinical vaginal specimens and in models of vaginal candidiasis, including a murine model and an in vitro tissue model. The ALS genes encode large cell-surface glycoproteins that are candidates for aiding C. albicans colonization of the vaginal epithelium and/or for promoting development of vaginal disease. Vaginal-specific patterns of ALS gene expression were detected using reverse transcription-PCR and suggested that ALS gene expression is specific to the host site where  C. albicans cells are located. The second experimental approach was prompted by reports in the scientific literature that suggested a positive association between elevated estrogen concentration and the incidence of vaginal candidiasis. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of estrogen on the growth characteristics and transcriptional profile of C. albicans  cultured in defined media. Addition of estrogen to C. albicans  cells resulted in increased germ tube formation and length in an estrogen-, dose- and strain-dependent manner, but did not have a significant effect on culture biomass. Genes that were differentially expressed in the presence of estrogen were defined by microarray analysis and included  CDR1 and CDR2. Analysis of estrogen-exposed strain DSY654, that lacks CDR1 and CDR2 coding sequences, showed a significantly decreased number of germ tube-forming cells in the presence of estrogen. PDR16 was the most highly up-regulated gene in strain DSY654 under the growth conditions assayed. The cell biology and gene expression data led to a model to explain how components of the phospholipid and sterol metabolic pathways may interact to affect C. albicans germ tube formation and length. Collectively these two different experimental approaches produced new insight into the interaction between C. albicans  and the vaginal environment.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291779165", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/87629"]}, {"authors": ["Carbonell, A.

In addition, holothurians are one of the taxa dominating epibenthic communities in different North Atlantic basins (Billet, 1991), where they can form dense aggregations.\r\nDespite the large literature on Atlantic echinoderms, the knowledge of this group in Northwest African waters primarily comes from the pioneering oceanographic expeditions carried out from late nineteenth century to mid twentieth century. However, the current knowledge of holothurians in Mauritanian waters is scarce, and only the works of Koehler and Vaney (1906), H\u00e9rouard (1929) and Massin (1993) were focused in this group and mainly on the fauna of the northern continental shelf.\r\nThis is a taxonomic and ecological study of the holothurians collected during the four multidisciplinary Spanish \u2013 Mauritanian surveys (Maurit) carried out from 2007 to 2010 on board R/V Vizconde de Eza in Mauritanian EEZ waters, between Cape Blanc (21\u00baN) and the Senegalese border (16\u00baN). A total of 291 stations were sampled between 80 and 2000 m depth, following a stratified random sampling methodology with and using a Lofoten commercial trawl (17.7 m horizontal opening, 5.5 m vertical opening and 35 mm mesh in the cod-end). \r\nThe holothurians collected in each trawl were sorted to morphospecies level, counted and weighed to obtain quantitative data on their abundance and biomass. Each specimen was photographed and a reference collection was preserved in 70% alcohol for further identification in the laboratory. The identification methodology included the study of the external and internal morphology by dissection and the microscopic study of the endoskeletal calcareous deposits. \r\nQuantitative data (numerical abundance and biomass) collected during Maurit-0811, were standardized to 0.1 km2 and their respective matrices were calculated to enable an analysis of similarity between stations using the Bray Curtis index. Statistical treatment was performed using PRIMER software package v.6.\r\nDuring the four cruises a total of 193,791 holothurians were collected in 128 of the 291 sampled stations, belonging to 15 species and 9 families. In terms of number of species, Synallactidae showed the highest specific richness (6 species), followed by Laetmogonidae (2 species). The others families were represented by only 1 species. \r\nEnypniastes eximia Theel, 1882, the only representative of the family Pelagothuriidae, showed the greatest occurrence (52%) and was also the dominant species, both in numbers and biomass.\r\nPaelopatides grisea Perrier, 1898 and Benthothuria funebris Perrier, 1898 were collected in about 40% of the stations and, due to their big size, they significantly contributed to the total biomass despite their low numerical abundance.  \r\nThe multidimensional scaling (MDS) and the dendrogram resulting from the multivariate analysis applied to biomass matrix clearly separated stations located in the deep-shell and upper slope (<300 m) from those located at greater depths along the continental slope. The dendrogram evidenced five groups, two of them corresponding to shelf and upper slope stations (80\u2013300 m) and the others including stations beyond 1000 m depth. Holothurians were almost absent between 300 and 1000 m in Mauritanian slope, which is in agreement with the results obtained by Billet (1991) in Porcupine Seabight (North Atlantic), where the abundance of holothurians was low in the break upper slope area (200 to 1000 m) but clearly increased beyond.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nBillet, D.S.M. 1991.

Additionally, extracting the embryo of the egg precludes the possibility of studying its\r\ndevelopment in its natural environment.

However, many of these cell-based approaches present practical issues for clinical translation such as ethical cell derivation, generation of potentially large numbers of homogenously prepared cells, and immune rejection. With the advent of induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cell technology, many of these issues may potentially be overcome.

By controlling the direction of flagella rotation, this process allows the organism to sense changes in its surroundings and migrate toward more favorable environments. The process of chemotaxis is controlled by the activity of an autophosphorylating histidine kinase, CheA. The work described in this thesis shows that Bacillus subtilis CheA differs from other members of this family of bacterial histidine kinases in two respects: it is able to achieve its maximum phosphorylation potential at very low ATP concentrations, and the phosphorylated form of the enzyme is very stable in the presence of ADP and other potential phosphoryl group acceptors. We have long hypothesized that attractant-bound methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) in B. subtilis increase the activity of CheA. Asparagine-bound McpB has been shown here to increase CheA activity in vitro, the first example of activation of a two-component signal transducing kinase by its proposed environmental ligand to date. Studies on the enteric chemotaxis system revealed that taxis toward certain sugars is mediated solely through a separate phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), involved in sugar transport. In B. subtilis, we have determined that taxis toward PTS carbohydrates is mediated both by MCPs and the PTS. Finally, a restriction map of the distal end of the 26kb fla/che operon has been deduced, which will be of value in attempts to clone additional chemotaxis genes in B. subtilis.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4829302", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/20879"]}, {"authors": ["Dimitrov, Valentin V."], "title": "Using Synthetic Nanopores for Single -Molecule Analyses: Detecting SNPs, Trapping DNA Molecules, and the Prospects for Sequencing DNA", "description": "86 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2009.This work focuses on studying properties of DNA molecules and DNA-protein interactions using synthetic nanopores, and it examines the prospects of sequencing DNA using synthetic nanopores. We have developed a method for discriminating between alleles that uses a synthetic nanopore to measure the binding of a restriction enzyme to DNA. There exists a field threshold for rupturing the DNA-protein complex in nanopores, which are larger in diameter than the double helix of a DNA molecule but smaller in diameter than the DNA-protein complex. We relate the binding strength to the field threshold at which the complex dissociates. We also describe a method of measuring the transition from double-stranded (dsDNA) to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), called the helix-coil transition, which is vital to biology. The force required to dissociate base pairs depends on whether the DNA is unzipped by pulling parallel to the bases or stretched by pulling transverse to the base pairs. We have probed the dichotomy in the force by studying the translocation of hairpin DNA in pores smaller in diameter than dsDNA. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to trap a single dsDNA molecule in a nanopore <3 nm in diameter. We use the fact that there is a voltage threshold for dsDNA to permeate a pore with diameter comparable to or smaller than the dsDNA double helix. The molecule is temporarily trapped by first applying a voltage higher than this threshold, and once the molecule is inside the nanopore, the voltage is reduced below the threshold. We have succeeded in trapping a lambda-DNA molecule for seconds in the pore. Moreover, if the duration of the trap is extremely long, we observe what may be signatures of the base pairs translocating through the pore. Finally, we report on our efforts in exploring four strategies for improving the electrical performance by reducing the parasitic membrane capacitances of synthetic nanopores: (1) increasing the thickness of Si3N4 membranes; (2) miniaturizing composite membranes consisting of Si3N4  and polyimide; (3) miniaturizing membranes formed from metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitors; and finally, and (4) compensating for the capacitance through external circuitry.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158304184", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/81137"]}, {"authors": ["Spring, Bryan Quilty"], "title": "Development & Application of Fluorescence Spectroscopy & Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging to Biology & Medicine", "description": "232 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.The dissertation is concerned with biophysical applications of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and development and application of fluorescence lifetime-resolved imaging microscopy (FLIM).

This setup is unique in that collation occurs digitally, converting the challenges faced by optical alignment, instability, and toxicity, into computational workload. By collating images with varied phase shifts using a liquid crystal phase modulator (LCPM), it is possible to create a topological map of a transparent specimen. However, due to the temporal acquisition of the frames to extract the map, the speed is limited due to the LCPM and the camera. We have incorporated a fast LCPM and a fast sCMOS camera to increase the speed such that the phase map retrieval will be possible in real time.

The primary purpose of this study was to determine how well instruction in agriculture and in biology could be integrated in a high school agriculture setting. This purpose was accomplished by testing the effect of the incorporation of biological principles instruction into a problem area in vocational agriculture on student achievement in agriculture and in applied biology. The effect of this incorporation on student attitudes was also measured.Methods. The population for this study consisted of all students in production vocational agriculture programs in Illinois. One hundred and four students from nine schools comprised the sample, 47 in the treatment group and 57 in the control group. Since random assignment of students to treatment groups was impossible, a quasi-experimental design was used. Treatments were randomly assigned to classes. A pretest was administered prior to the beginning of instruction, and a posttest and student attitude instruments were administered immediately following the completion of instruction. Pretest scores, student background categories, previous biology experience categories, post graduation plans, and attitudes toward agriculture were used as covariate measures to control for possible pretreatment group achievement differences. Data were analyzed by means of analysis of variance and covariance, t-tests, and correlational and descriptive statistics.Findings.

Males undergo testicular regression during the non-mating season and testicular recrudescence during the pre-mating season. The present investigation was undertaken to begin to study the role of serum FSH, LH, and particularly PRL in testicular recrudescence in the male black bear. The specific objectives of this research were: (1) to determine if testicular LH-, FSH-, and PRL-receptor mRNA abundance changes during testicular recrudescence and is associated with changes in serum LH, FSH, PRL, and T and (2) to determine if suppression of the spring increase in serum PRL concentrations affects testicular recrudescence. The major findings were: (1) the abundance of testicular LH and PRL receptor mRNA changes seasonally during testicular recrudescence: both increased dramatically in March during mid-recrudescence, coincident with increased serum concentrations of PRL and T; and (2) the treatment of male bears with Parlodel LAR during testicular recrudescence prevented the spring increase in serum PRL concentrations and was associated with lower levels of testicular LHr and PRLr mRNA in March, suppressed serum T concentrations in March and April, and smaller testis size in May. Collectively, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that increasing serum PRL concentrations associated with lengthening day length may promote testicular recrudescence in the black bear by enhancing steroidogenesis. This thesis also provides new information on the reproductive biology of the male polar bear. There were three major findings: (1) testicular size is positively correlated with breeding season and serum T concentrations; (2) serum LH is only detectable during the breeding season in April, coincident with peak serum concentrations of T; and (3) serum PRL concentrations are positively correlated with day length. Both of these studies contribute novel information to the field of bear reproductive biology and can be used to improve assisted reproduction.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158306700", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/83654"]}, {"authors": ["Kumar, Manish"], "title": "Biomimetic Membranes as New Materials for Applications in Environmental Engineering and Biology", "description": "124 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2010.In broad terms, this work has shown that biology provides excellent paradigms for engineering materials and processes that are efficient and sustainable and that this \"reverse engineering\" approach can enrich our understanding of underlying biological phenomena.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158306465", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/83419"]}, {"authors": ["Nuell, Mark Jay"], "title": "Isolation and Characterization of the Chloroperoxidase Gene From Caldariomyces Fumago", "description": "131 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1986.The chloroperoxidase gene (cpo gene) from the filamentous fungus, Caldariomyces fumago, was isolated within a 16.3 kilobase DNA fragment in the vector LambdaEMBL3. The DNA sequence of the gene and its proximal flanking regions was determined and analyzed by using the programs available on the BIONET National Computer Resource for Molecular Biology. Such analysis provided the primary sequence of the protein and identified regions of DNA sequence which have structures related by symmetry operations.

The actual function of DNA sequences in the flanking regions remains to be determined. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA versions of the cpo gene sequence shows that the gene lacks introns and does not have the typical AATAAA polyadenylation signal.

A technique known as patch clamping is used in the study of a channel\u2019s physiology. With ligand-gate channels, the binding of a small-molecule ligand (e.g. acetylcholine for the nAChR) favors the channel transitioning into the open state. The channel activation occurs on the microsecond timescale though current measurements are limited by the solution exchange time. The state-of-the-art system applies a solution using a pizeoelectrically-controlled double lumen theta tube.\r\nCurrent ligand application protocols drive a piezoelectrically-controlled, double lumen theta tube via a first-order analog-filtered rectangular pulse. The resulting trajectory results in significant ringing (unwanted oscillation) in the theta tube as the pulse length is shortened. To attenuate the ringing artifacts, analog-filtering increases the rise time (exchange time of the theta tube) which again diminishes one\u2019s ability to study the kinetics of a channel at an extreme precision.

All perches were constructed from steel pipe and cooling was achieved by maintaining a constant water flow rate. In a small scale field study, broilers (3-7 wks of age) were provided either water cooled floor perches or air-equilibrated floor perches in a hot ambient environment. Occupation of water cooled perches was 8x greater than that of air-equilibrated perches, demonstrating a purposeful thermoregulatory use of water cooled perches. Use of water cooled perches increased with increasing duration of heat exposure. Broilers provided water cooled perches experienced greater body weight gain, increased feed consumption and greater efficiency of gain than their counterparts provided air-equilibrated perches. The largest treatment differences were observed during the fourth week of heat exposure. Behavioral preferences for diameter and height of water cooled perch were investigated in two age groups (3 wk and 6 wk) of perch naive broilers exposed to a hot ambient environment. Floor level perches proximal to the water supply within the pen were preferred by both age groups. A direct relationship was observed between diameter of perch preferred and age. Further study, demonstrated that water cooled perch use increased with increasing ambient temperature for both 3 wk and 6 wk of age broilers. Duration of perching bouts and methods of water cooled perch use by broilers were dependent upon ambient temperature, age, height, diameter, and position of perches within the pen. The physiological responses of broilers to perch cooling in a hot ambient environment were investigated. Peripheral vasomotion in the feet of broilers provided water cooled perches in a hot ambient environment spared the energy expenditure for thermoregulatory effort and permitted blood flow to be directed to organs not involved in heat dissipation. Furthermore, cooling of perches prior to, or at the onset of heat exposure minimizes physiological disruption and maximizes thermoregulatory benefit in growing broilers exposed to hot ambient temperatures.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4827793", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/19370"]}, {"authors": ["Whitis, Judith Davidson"], "title": "A regional survey of writing in six subject areas in colleges and universities accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools", "description": "This study investigated the nature and frequency of writing tasks undertaken by students in colleges and universities granting bachelor's degrees in institutions accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

The response rate of the survey was 309/450 or 69.0% with each of the six subject areas recording response rates exceeding 60.0%. Questions on the survey were grouped into categories that related to the study's ten research questions: (1) class and instructor characteristics, (2) writing and related activities, (3) reasons for writing, (4) longer writing assignments, (5) intellectual uses of writing, (6) teaching techniques, (7) audiences for student writing, (8) responses to student writing, (9) length of writing assignments, (10) time allowed for writing assignments. The survey also included a section in which respondents answered questions and expressed their views on student writing.Overall, results indicated that writing occurs across subject areas in colleges, most frequently in the forms of note-taking, discursive writing of a paragraph or longer, and short-answer responses. College instructors stress application of subject area concepts and subject area information more than development of writing skills and personal experience. Informational uses of writing dominate student writing with personal and imaginative uses occurring infrequently. Prewriting, writing and revising, and postwriting techniques are used only sparingly in content classes. College instructors' responses are related to students' thinking processes, accuracy of conclusions, and organization. Subject area instructors accept joint responsibility with freshman writing instructors for teaching students to write, and they feel adequately prepared to do it. Most college instructors have not heard of the writing process movement, but most have heard of the writing across the curriculum movement.Additional conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made.

This membrane-bound oxidase catalyzes the two-electron oxidation of ubiquinol and the four-electron reduction of oxygen to water. Enzyme turnover generates proton and voltage gradients across the bilayer. The oxidase is a heterodimer containing three heme prosthetic groups, $b\\sb{558},$ $b\\sb{595},$ and d. To explain the functional properties of the oxidase, a simple model has been proposed in which the heme prosthetic groups define two separate active sites on opposite sides of the membrane at which the oxidation of ubiquinol (heme $b\\sb{558})$ and the reduction of oxygen to water (hemes $b\\sb{595}$ and d) take place. Two histidines, His19 and His186, both in subunit I have been shown to affect the incorporation of the hemes as well as the activity of the oxidase. His19 is proposed to be an axial ligand to either $b\\sb{595}$ or d hemes, whereas His186 is believed to be one of the two axial ligands to heme $b\\sb{558}.$This thesis describes a combination of molecular biology, biophysical characterization and use of artificial proteases to try to understand the structure-function relationship of the cytochrome bd oxidase. A novel experiment is described in detail to show proximity relationships between sites on the surface of the two subunits of the oxidase. The artificial protease iron (S)-1- (p-(bromoacetamido)benzyl) -EDTA (Fe-BABE) was conjugated to selective reactive cysteines placed in subunits I and II and then activated with $\\rm H\\sb2O\\sb2$ and ascorbate, and hydrolysis products were isolated and analyzed. Among other results, we found that residues 39 and 48 both of subunit II are within 12A of residues 255 and 337 of subunit I in the putative quinone-binding domain (Q-loop).Site-directed mutagenesis and biophysical characterization were used: to construct a functional cytochrome bd oxidase devoid of cysteinyl residues, to try to determine the remaining ligands to the heme groups and also to identify residues that are involved in the oxidation and/or binding of ubiquinol. A successful construction of a cysteine-less oxidase is described in detail which appears to have the high-spin heme, heme $b\\sb{595},$ being converted to a low-spin heme upon purification. Also described is some work done in collaboration with members of our laboratory in the determination of the remaining axial ligands to the heme groups. Met393 is proposed to be the second axial ligand to heme $b\\sb{558}$ and His19 might be involved in the ligation of heme $b\\sb{595}.$U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4832171", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/23748"]}, {"authors": ["Carlson, Joseph Woodward"], "title": "Supramolecular Architectures in Molecular Medicine: Visualizing and Manipulating the Structure of Protein-Lipid Surfaces", "description": "101 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1999.Molecular complexes play a number of key roles in medicine and biology. Understanding how these complexes behave at interfaces, as well as controlling their structure, is of fundamental interest to science and technology. Lipoproteins, a complex of protein and lipid, serve as the primary transporter of cholesterol and other lipids throughout the body. There is a direct correlation between the presence of certain lipoprotein species and the incidence of coronary artery disease. High density lipoproteins are responsible for the removal of cholesterol from the peripheral tissues and, as such, lead to a reduction in the risk of heart disease.Reconstituted high density lipoproteins have been studied with the atomic force microscope. This microscope has revealed new insight into the structure of these supramolecular aggregates and their interfacial behavior. In order to allow accurate quantitation of lateral size a new imaging standard was developed. This standard, peptide modified colloidal gold, has been used in solution to solve tip induced artifacts and to correct for tip changes simultaneous with sample imaging. A spontaneous fusion process has been observed and examined, revealing the important structural role of apolipoprotein A-I, even in an interfacial setting.These discoidal rHDL have been found to generate a new form of supported bilayer structure which has been particulary amenable to atomic force microscope study and manipulation. The microscope has revealed the bilayer structure of these discs through nanodissection. It has also been used to control the spontaneous fusion process of these discs, resulting in spatially defined bilayer domains of nanometer scale dimensions. By using a source of exogenous lipid in solution the AFM has been used to induce lipid exchange with these surfaces, resulting in a compositional change of the supported bilayer in a spatially controlled manner. A model of this process has been proposed based on defects introduced by the AFM tip binding vesicles, which subsequently fuse with the surface. Finally, the AFM has been used to direct proteins to spatially selected regions, allowing the fabrication of heterogeneous membrane protein containing surfaces.In separate studies, myoglobin has been used to study the fluorescence lifetime behavior of oriented biomolecular surfaces. These studies have revealed differences in lifetime between differentially oriented myoglobin molecules, consistent with differential accessibility of the heme pocket to quenching by oxygen. A computational study of the dependence of linear dichroism on the distribution of protein orientation angle has revealed a constrained degenerate solution, which has impact on all attempts to describe protein orientation with this technique.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158301040", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/77479"]}, {"authors": ["Kumar, Manish"], "title": "Biomimetic Membranes as New Materials for Applications in Environmental Engineering and Biology", "description": "124 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2010.In broad terms, this work has shown that biology provides excellent paradigms for engineering materials and processes that are efficient and sustainable and that this \"reverse engineering\" approach can enrich our understanding of underlying biological phenomena.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291774956", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/83419"]}, {"authors": ["Fritz, Gary Gruber"], "title": "An Investigation of the Concept Dimension of Teaching Strategies of Bolivian Teachers in Biology", "description": "163 p.Thesis (Educat.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1971.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291756045", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/62454"]}, {"authors": ["Sanford, James Walker"], "title": "Observations on the Biology and Control of the Dusky Sap Beetle, Carpophilus Lugubris (Murray), Infesting Sweet Corn in Illinois", "description": "60 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1963.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291752208", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/58565"]}, {"authors": ["Au, Chi-Tak Doug"], "title": "Molecular Biology of the Cytochrome O Terminal Oxidase of Escherichia Coli (Cloning, Sequencing, Dna)", "description": "103 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1987.My thesis research has dealt mainly with a genetic approach to studying the cytochrome o terminal oxidase complex of Escherichia coli.

Nanomaterials have played an important role in the advances: they have served as model systems to explore nanoscale physics and as building blocks to develop nanoscale tools and devices. The rational applications of nanomaterials require understanding of their fundamental properties. Early studies of nanomaterials---characterization of individual nanomaterials (e.g., carbon nanotubes)---have mostly focused on their basic mechanical and electrical properties. Most of these studies have relied on tools and methods rooted in solid-state physics, such as electron microscopes, scanning probe microscopes, and microfabricated testing devices; thus, the tools and methods were difficult to incorporate &quot;soft&quot; materials, rooted in chemistry and biology, into the studies. Despite enormous potential of technologies that integrate nanomaterials (more generally, nanotechnology and the physical sciences) and &quot;soft&quot; materials (more generally, chemical and biological systems), the basic knowledge of how &quot;hard&quot; nanomaterials interact with &quot;soft&quot; materials and how to interface &quot;inorganic&quot; nanomaterials with &quot;organic&quot; biomolecules and living biological systems was lacking.In this dissertation, we studied the interfaces and interactions of &quot;hard&quot; nanomaterials and &quot;soft&quot; materials, from fluids to living biological cells, at the nanoscale and presented a new concept to interface nanomaterials with living biological systems for biological and biophysical studies inside living cells at the nanoscale. In the first part, we present the study of how fluids interact with nanomaterials and how fluids behave at very small length scales, using nanotubes as model systems. In the second part, we present the development of nanotechnology-based tools for single cell studies at the nanoscale: single nanotube-based needle nanoprobes for biological and chemical sensing and high-precision nanoscale delivery methods for biological and biophysical studies inside living cells.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291765740", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72230"]}, {"authors": ["Beckstead, Julie"], "title": "A Community's Natural Resistance to Invasion by Cheatgrass and the Effects of Associational Herbivory", "description": "126 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2001.Linking theories of invasion biology with that of associational herbivory, I found that (1) cheatgrass was a highly utilized food source for generalist grasshoppers, (2) among native plant species, the amount of herbivory corresponded with their total percent nitrogen and other plant traits, and (3) a native grass, Elymus elymoides, experienced higher herbivory in high- than in low-density cheatgrass patches, supporting the attractant-source hypothesis that predicts associational susceptibility.

A main reason for such an impact is that every nanomaterial, such as metallic nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots (QDs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and magnetic nanoparticles has unique physical and chemical properties that can be used for various applications. For practical use of nanomaterials in various applications, however, it is necessary to assemble nanomaterials in controlled manner and manipulate their behaviors. This control of nanomaterials can be accomplished by functionalizing the nanomaterials with biopolymers, such as DNA. In this work, DNA has been used along with nanomaterials to demonstrate their usage in diverse applications.Precise control of the position of and distance between nanomaterials is one of the key challenges in nanoscale science and technology. A methodology to site-specifically control the distances between nanomaterials has been demonstrated using phosphorothioate modified DNA as a template along with a bifunctional linker. A bifunctional linker binds to a phosphorothioate modified position on the DNA and provides an anchor point for nanomaterials assembly. As nanoparticles can be covalently bound to those anchor points on DNA, they can be precisely placed at accurate positions of a DNA template. Since DNA can work as 1D, 2D, or 3D templates due to its programmable properties and miniature size, nanoparticles can be assembled on those DNA templates forming assemblies with controlled distances. Furthermore, as bifunctional linkers can be easily modified, this methodology is versatile and can be used for other molecules. Controlled conjugation of multiple proteins on DNA has been demonstrated as well.The interface between nanomaterials science and biology offers a grand opportunity for biodetection of various analytes. The target recognition capability of DNA, especially functional DNA, provides a novel way to use nanomaterials as a signal transducer for biosensing. Particularly as DNA can interact with AuNPs in labeled or label-free ways, different kinds of colorimetric sensors can be developed. Herein, lead (Pb2+) targeting colorimetric sensor using lead specific DNAzyme and AuNPs based on label-free method was designed which has detection limit lower than fluorescence based sensor. Furthermore, colorimetric uranyl (UO22+) sensors based on uranyl specific DNAzymes and AuNPs were developed using both labeled and label-free methods and their general properties and performances were compared. Even though DNAzyme with identical sequences were used, the two sensors showed differences in the advantages and disadvantages, versatility, limitations, and potential applications. This work provides a general guideline for the choice of detection methods for colorimetric detection of various analytes.Finally, high resolution patterning of DNA using electrohydrodynamic jet printing method has been demonstrated. This modified ink jet printing method, using electrohydrodynamic force instead of conventional thermal or piezoelectric forces, enables to print high resolution DNA features smaller than 100 nm at high speed in non-contact mode. It has been shown that the e-jet printed DNA is active and their potential applications have been discussed by demonstrating DNA aptamer-based biosensing and DNA-directed nanoparticle assembly.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291765674", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72164"]}, {"authors": ["Sakai, Ayano"], "title": "Study of Enzyme Evolution Within the MLE Subgroup Focusing on Characterizing Member Enzymes for the Purpose of Discovering Relationships Among Sequence, Structure, and Function", "description": "472 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2009.This investigation explores sequence/structure/function relationships of enzymes by elucidating interesting insights into the structural basis for catalysis as well as potential design principles that can be used to develop catalysts for new reactions. The enolase superfamily possesses the most ubiquitous protein fold in Nature while the muconate lactonizing enzyme (MLE) subgroup represents the most divergent in chemical reactions in the superfamily; therefore, the MLE subgroup is an excellent candidate to appreciate chemistry driven evolution of enzymes. The MLE subgroup, whose members have diverse sequences but make up enzyme catalytic domains of close homology, is a good target of study for understanding the sequence/structure/function relationships. Exploring characterized members in the subgroup has improved our understanding of underlying mechanisms, and exploring members of the subgroup whose functions have not yet been assigned will offer new insights into possible metabolic pathways and enzyme evolution. In order to achieve an efficient, integrative research strategy to move from genomic sequence to actual function assignment, our new approach to assigning correct function to enzymes in the MLE subgroup incorporates two analytic techniques: operon context analysis and computational analysis, along with  in vitro enzymology. The benefits of this approach for accurate prediction of a function for selected members of the MLE subgroup are discussed. Integrative analysis of protein functions guided by both sequence assessment and structural prediction will revolutionize the study of protein function assignment in the field of Biology and will promote advances in understanding the relationship between function and structure of proteins in science.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291765913", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72403"]}, {"authors": ["Bross, Phillip Ralph"], "title": "Quantitative Photoacoustic Reaction-Rate Measurements Under Microcomputer Control", "description": "163 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1981.Quantitative photoacoustic reaction-rate measurements under microcomputer control are demonstrated by the reaction of lysine and leucine with ninhydrin in a starch matrix. Coground amino acid/starch standards are analyzed in 200 seconds using initial reaction-rate conditions with a percent relative standard deviation generally better than 20% for 0.1 - 3.7 wt% standards. A single analysis requires approximately 10 mg of sample and 40 (mu)1 of ninhydrin reagent. The implications of this new photoacoustic application are the potential analysis of proteins in grain samples as well as other quantitative surface measurements. Non-kinetic quantitative data for tris-(2,2'-bipyridyl)-ruthenium(II) ion-exchanged into a 13X zeolite are also presented. A calibration curve for the ruthenium chromophore was prepared by cogrinding tris-(2,2'-bipyridyl)-ruthenium(II) dichloride hexahydrate with various amounts of 600 mesh 13X zeolite. Percent relative standard deviations from 1-8% for 0.2 - 2.7 wt% ruthenium salt concentrations were obtained. In addition, a quantitative calibration curve for samarium oxide was prepared by simply mixing controlled particle size distributions of samarium oxide and barium sulfate.Surfaces play a crucial role in a variety of diverse chemical processes. Many areas of research in catalysis, energy development, semiconductor physics, materials science, biology, and medicine require high technology in surface science. The principle advantage of photoacoustic spectroscopy is that it permits the acquisition of optical spectra similar to those from optical transmission spectroscopy on the surface of any type of opaque condensed phase material.The photoacoustic effect is an energy conversion process transforming light energy into acoustic energy. In the absence of fluorescence and photochemical reactions, the absorption of modulated monochromatic light by a sample manifest itself as a periodic thermal fluctuation at the modulation frequency as a result of nonradiative de-excitation processes within the sample. The resultant heat flow into the surrounding gas creates a periodic pressure change detected by a sensitive microphone in an enclosed cell.A lockin amplifier is used to enhance the signal-to-noise of the microphone output. The analog output from the lockin amplifier is transferred to the digital domain with a 10 KHz voltage-to-frequency converter. An ADD-8080 microcomputer provides the artificial intelligence for the automated photoacoustic spectrometer. BASIC language programming allows operator control of the experimental instrumental parameters and flexibility in data manipulation and graphical display.The single beam photoacoustic spectrometer was constructed from a 300W high intensity Eimac xenon lamp, Heath monochromator, and Brookdeal 9505E lockin amplifier. The detector was a one-inch diameter General Radio electret microphone. A silicon photodiode was used as a reference detector for compensation of temporal light intensity changes.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291760796", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/67255"]}, {"authors": ["Floyd, Philip Daniel"], "title": "Microseparation Strategies for the Assay of Neuronal Samples", "description": "162 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1999.The HPLC research presented here represents our first attempt to use microbore HPLC in the analysis of peptides from an identified cluster of neurons.

The serovar S. typhimurium causes a typhoid-like fever in mice which serves as an animal model of enteric fever. The lambdoid phages, Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2, contribute significantly to S. typhimurium virulence. We have been studying biology of these phage to determine the effects of Gifsy-1 and Gifsy-2 on the virulence of S. typhimurium. The Gifsy-2 phage carries the periplasmic superoxide dismutase gene, sodCI. Using the IVET system, we identified a Salmonella specific gene grvA, a single open reading frame inserted in the opposite orientation in the tail operon of the Gifsy-2 phage. Contrary to classic virulence gene phenotypes, null mutants of grvA are more virulent than wild type when intraperitoneally inoculated into mice in competition assays. The  grvA+ gene on a multi-copy plasmid also confers the anti-virulence phenotype. The anti-virulence phenotype conferred by the  grvA null mutation and the grvA+ plasmid requires wild type sodCI. We have found that a second anti-virulence gene, grvB, located on the Gifsy-1 phage is also included in the GrvA-SodCI virulence cascade. Competition assays with null and over-expressing mutants show that the grvB gene confers anti-virulence phenotypes similar to that of grvA. The effects of grvB on virulence are also dependent upon the presence of wild type sodCI. These results suggest that GrvA and GrvB interact in the same virulence pathway to affect virulence in a SodCI dependent manner. Thus, in a wild type situation, GrvA and GrvB decrease the pathogenicity of S. typhimurium in the host, possibly by affecting resistance to toxic oxygen species.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291778303", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/86767"]}, {"authors": ["Hil\u00e1rio, A", "Comas, MC", "Azevedo, L", "Pinheiro, L", "Ivanov, MK", "Cunha, MR"], "title": "First record of a Vestimentifera (Polychaeta: Siboglinidae) from chemosynthetic habitats in the western Mediterranean Sea-Biogeographical implications and future exploration", "description": "A new population of vestimentiferan tubeworms was discovered during a recent expedition to a mud volcano field in the Alboran Sea, western Mediterranean Sea.

This is the first record of a vestimentiferan species in the western basin of the Mediterranean, an area with direct connection to the Atlantic via the Strait of Gibraltar and therefore of great importance to the study of distributional patterns and evolution of Mediterranean species. We examine the current hypotheses on the biogeographic distribution of vestimentiferan species in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea and conclude that independently of when Lamellibrachia colonized the Mediterranean, neither the present hydrological settings of both Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, nor vestimentiferans reproductive biology are impeditive to the presence of the Mediterranean species of Lamellibrachia in the NE Atlantic.

Nevertheless, its algorithmic strategy exhibits some limitations since it is based on statistical behavior of the average and considers averages weighted by scores not necessarily positive. Hence, we propose to take the median instead of the average and to use absolutes scores in ISA's structure. Furthermore, a generalized function is also introduced in the algorithm in order to improve its algorithmic strategy for detecting high value or low value biclusters. The effects of these simple modifications on the performance of the biclustering algorithm are evaluated through an experimental comparative study involving synthetic data sets and real data from the organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The experimental results show that the proposed variations of ISA outperform the original version in many situations. Absolute scores in ISA are shown to be essential for the correct interpretation of the biclusters found by the algorithm. The median instead of the average turns the biclustering algorithm more resilient to outliers in the data sets.

Sampling was performed monthly on six tagged colonies during one year and specimens were histologically processed. A. wollastoni was found to be a gonochoric broadcast spawner. Gametogenesis took place within the primary transversal mesenteries, and followed an annual cycle. The reproductive season coincided with an increase in seawater temperature but spawning, inferred from the disappearance of gametes, likely happened after the sea surface temperature peak of the year (September 2009). Polyp fecundity ranged from 1 to 309 oocytes/polyp. A decrease in polyp fecundity was detected in samples at the higher pre-spawning maturity stage, indicating possible repetitive spawning or oocyte absorption. Intra-colonial comparisons revealed a longer duration of the reproductive cycle in the medial colony section, and a gradient of increased oocyte size towards the apical section, possibly due to intra-colonial differences in energy allocation between reproduction and other biological processes, or as a strategy against predation on gametes/larvae.

Secondary\r\nmetabolic pathways in grape berries, mainly polyphenolic pathways, are responsible for wine\r\nquality-traits such as flavor, texture, color, astringency and aroma, due to the production of\r\nphenolic compounds. Thus, potential strategies to increase berry quality by targeting these\r\npathways are important in a context of environmental adversity. These pathways are tightly\r\nregulated by an array of molecular mechanisms, including activation of gene transcription by\r\nspecific transcription factors and post-transcriptional regulation in multiple forms, as, for\r\ninstance, by microRNAs. It was recently found that, before being processed into mature miRNAs,\r\nthe primary transcripts of miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) could encode for small regulatory peptides, thus\r\ndesignated miRNA-encoded peptides (micropeptides - miPEPs). These miPEPs enhance the\r\ntranscription and accumulation of the corresponding pri-miRNA and, thus, of the mature miRNA,\r\nin a positive feedback loop, that subsequently lead to an accentuated downregulation of the\r\nrespective miRNA-targeted genes.\r\nThe objective of this work was to take advantage of this recent breakthrough and to\r\nvalidate the exogenous application of miPEPs as a tool for modulating secondary metabolic\r\npathways in grape berry cells, thus, their quality-traits. For that, three candidate micropeptides,\r\nmiPEP-UFGT1 (miPEP3631a), miPEP-MYB5b (miPEP396a) and miPEP-MYBPA1 (miPEP164c),\r\nscreened and identified in silico were exogenously added to Gamay Freaux grape berry cells and\r\nmolecular biology and classic biochemical approaches were performed to assess the influence of\r\nthese miPEPs on the transcription of key genes involved in secondary metabolic pathways\r\nassociated with grape berry quality, as well as on the biochemical activity of the corresponding\r\nenzymes, and on the final concentration of secondary metabolites such as anthocyanins,\r\nproanthocyanidins and total phenolics. The exogenous application of the miPEP ultimately\r\ntargeting transcription factor MYBPA1 (miPEP-MYBPA1) resulted in a strong up-regulation of\r\ngenes involved in anthocyanin synthesis (VvUFGT1), transport and accumulation in the vacuole\r\n(VvMATE1 and VvGST4) as well as on the biochemical activity of UFGT. This was probably\r\nbecause, simultaneously, miPEP-MYBPA1 led to a miR164c-mediated downregulation of the\r\nproanthocyanidin-biosynthetic pathway, one that directly competes for substrate with the\r\nanthocyanin-biosynthetic pathway, by inducing a decrease in VvLAR1 expression and LAR\r\nbiochemical activity, and also in proanthocyanidin concentration. Thus, miPEP-MYBPA1\r\napplication is a new and promising strategy to modulate secondary metabolic pathways in grape\r\nberry cells towards the synthesis and accumulation of more anthocyanins, by taking advantage of\r\nplant miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms.O cultivo da videira \u00e9 altamente influenciado por fatores de stresse bi\u00f3ticos e abi\u00f3ticos\r\nque afetam a sua produtividade e a qualidade da uva, resultando em grandes perdas\r\necon\u00f3micas.

The in-depth characterization of such resources is\r\nindispensable to modern day biology, as it tries to understand the molecular basis underpinning\r\nimportant crop traits. The deeper the knowledge on germplasm diversity, the vaster the number of\r\ntools available to improve the way by which humans interact with plants. A trend in the last few\r\nhundred years is the loss of genetic diversity driven by an intensive selection of cultivars that provide\r\nmore, while requiring less resources and care. Similar genetic erosion has been a key feature of\r\ngrapevine (Vitis vinifera L.), one of the most significant crops in the world. Presently, it is acknowledged\r\nthat conservation and characterization of the existing genetic diversity of local varieties is a priority.\r\nThe research group at CIBIO has been addressing grapevine biology using next-generation sequencing\r\n(NGS) and whole genome re-sequencing strategies. The main objective of this project was to use NGS\r\nand bioinformatics skills to generate a deeper understanding of evolutionary relationships between\r\ngrapevine cultivars, based on a pre-existing dataset of 100 genomes, re-sequenced at medium-to-low\r\nsequencing depth. The framework for this work was the implementation of probabilistic methods that\r\naccount for nucleotide uncertainty, and make accurate inferences from low coverage data. Samples\r\nincluded several Vitis species plus a collection of wild and domesticated grapevine genotypes.\r\nSubsequent PCA analysis resolved the different species and separated wild from domesticated\r\ngrapevine. It also allowed the establishment of six core populations within grapevine samples, which\r\nincluded two wild, one table and three wine grapevine populations. These populations were\r\ncharacterized across the genome, for a series of statistics associated with nucleotide diversity and\r\npresence of selection signatures. A clear decrease in nucleotide diversity was observed between East\r\nand West wild grapevine populations, a reduction that was also observed between wild and\r\ndomesticated grapevine populations, though domesticated grapevine still maintained high levels of\r\ndiversity. Results were consistent with an origin of domestication for grapevine in the Near East, but\r\nalso substantiate a tentative introgression from wild grapevine into European wine varieties. We then\r\nused a novel statistic called De-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS), to combine four\r\npreviously computed statistics for detection of selection signatures. As a case study, we addressed\r\nselection from wild genotypes expanding form their speciation center (East) to the edge of the\r\nexpansion range (West). From these scores, we extracted the percentile 95% genomic regions, and\r\nanalyzed its genes for annotation and Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment. A lot of genes were associated with abiotic and biotic stress, programmed cell death, drought resistance, calcium\r\nsignaling, sterol metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. The highest ranking\r\nDCMS score proved to contain a relevant gene of interest, in the form of a resistance gene containing\r\nan NB-ARC domain, putatively involved in the response to pathogen infection. Collectively, results\r\nsuggest that wild grapevine migration westward across Europe involved selection of genes strongly\r\nassociated with encountering new pathogens and adapting to new environments. The workflow\r\ndeveloped in the present thesis proved to be reliable to detect population genetic events, and the\r\ngenerated scripts helped accelerate the bioinformatics process to compute statistics such as DXY, plot\r\nbetter graphs to empower the analysis, and quickly find genes within positions of interest across the\r\ngenome. Results provide strong new insight into grapevine domestication history, and the\r\nbioinformatics tools can be further applied to new comparisons, geared towards uncovering the genes\r\nunderlying selection signatures across the grapevine genome.O germoplasma vegetal \u00e9 um recurso natural valioso, com aplica\u00e7\u00f5es significativas quer em\r\nbiologia fundamental, quer em biotecnologia.

Semelhante eros\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica tem sido observada na\r\nvideira (Vitis vinifera L.), uma das culturas mais importantes do mundo. Atualmente, reconhece-se\r\nque a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da diversidade gen\u00e9tica de variedades locais \u00e9 uma prioridade.\r\nO grupo de pesquisa do CIBIO tem vindo a abordar a biologia da videira usando Next Generation\r\nSequencing (NGS) e estrat\u00e9gias de re-sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o do genoma. O principal objetivo deste projeto foi\r\nusar as possibilidades do NGS e da bioinform\u00e1tica para gerar um conhecimento mais detalhado das\r\nrela\u00e7\u00f5es evolutivas entre variedades de videira, com base num conjunto de dados pr\u00e9-existente de 100\r\ngenomas, re-sequenciados com uma cobertura de sequencia\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia a baixa. Na base deste\r\ntrabalho esteve a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00e9todos probabil\u00edsticos que t\u00eam em conta a incerteza da\r\natribui\u00e7\u00e3o de nucle\u00f3tidos e fazem infer\u00eancias precisas a partir de dados de baixa cobertura.

A an\u00e1lise subsequente do PCA resolveu as diferentes esp\u00e9cies e separou a selvagem\r\nda videira domesticada. Tamb\u00e9m permitiu o estabelecimento de seis popula\u00e7\u00f5es principais dentro de\r\namostras de videira, que inclu\u00edam duas popula\u00e7\u00f5es selvagens, uma de mesa e tr\u00eas de vinho. Essas\r\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es foram caracterizadas em todo o genoma, recorrendo a uma s\u00e9rie de estat\u00edsticas\r\nassociadas \u00e0 diversidade de nucle\u00f3tidos e \u00e0 presen\u00e7a de assinaturas de sele\u00e7\u00e3o. Foi observada uma\r\nclara diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na diversidade de nucle\u00f3tidos entre as popula\u00e7\u00f5es de videira selvagem de Leste e\r\nOeste, uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o que tamb\u00e9m foi observada entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es de videiras selvagens e\r\ndomesticadas, embora a videira domesticada ainda mantivesse altos n\u00edveis de diversidade. Os\r\nresultados foram consistentes com a origem da domestica\u00e7\u00e3o da videira no Oriente, mas tamb\u00e9m\r\nsubstanciam uma putativa introgress\u00e3o secund\u00e1ria da videira selvagem nas variedades de vinho\r\neuropeias. Em seguida, us\u00e1mos uma estat\u00edstica recente chamada De-correlated composite of multiple\r\nsignals (DCMS), para combinar quatro estat\u00edsticas para a detec\u00e7\u00e3o de assinaturas de sele\u00e7\u00e3o. Como caso de estudo, abord\u00e1mos a sele\u00e7\u00e3o de gen\u00f3tipos selvagens ao se expandirem do seu centro de\r\nespecia\u00e7\u00e3o (Leste) at\u00e9 \u00e0 borda do intervalo de expans\u00e3o (Oeste). A partir desses valores de DCMS,\r\nextra\u00edmos as regi\u00f5es gen\u00f3micas do percentil 0,95 e analis\u00e1mos os seus genes para anota\u00e7\u00e3o e\r\nenriquecimento de termos Gene Ontology (GO). Muitos genes estavam associados a stresse abi\u00f3tico\r\ne bi\u00f3tico, morte celular programada, resist\u00eancia \u00e0 secura, sinaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e1lcio, metabolismo de\r\nester\u00f3is e homeostasia de esp\u00e9cies reactivas de oxig\u00e9nio (ROS). A pontua\u00e7\u00e3o mais elevada do DCMS\r\nprovou conter um putativo gene de interesse, um gene de resist\u00eancia contendo um dom\u00ednio NB-ARC,\r\npossivelmente envolvido na resposta \u00e0 infec\u00e7\u00e3o por patog\u00e9nicos. Colectivamente, os resultados\r\nsugerem que a migra\u00e7\u00e3o da videira selvagem para o Oeste da Europa envolveu a selec\u00e7\u00e3o de genes\r\nfortemente associados ao encontro de novos patog\u00e9nicos e \u00e0 adapta\u00e7\u00e3o a novos ambientes. O fluxo\r\nde trabalho desenvolvido nesta tese provou ser fi\u00e1vel para detectar eventos gen\u00e9ticos populacionais,\r\nos scripts gerados ajudaram a acelerar o processo bioinform\u00e1tico para calcular estat\u00edsticas como DXY,\r\ntra\u00e7ar gr\u00e1ficos melhores para favorecer a an\u00e1lise e rapidamente encontrar genes em posi\u00e7\u00f5es de\r\ninteresse no genoma. Os resultados apresentam uma nova vis\u00e3o sobre a hist\u00f3ria da domestica\u00e7\u00e3o da\r\nvideira e as ferramentas de bioinform\u00e1tica podem ser aplicadas a novas compara\u00e7\u00f5es, dirigidas para\r\na an\u00e1lise dos genes subjacentes \u00e0s assinaturas de sele\u00e7\u00e3o no genoma da videira.Trabalho desenvolvido no \u00e2mbito do projeto NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000007, financiado pelo\r\nPrograma Operacional Regional do Norte (NORTE2020), sob al\u00e7ado do projeto Acordo de Parceria\r\nPORTUGAL 2020, atrav\u00e9s do Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional (ERDF).

The diverse beetle family Cerambycidae shows considerable variation in mate location strategies, roles of volatile pheromones, and organs involved in pheromone release, making it an ideal group for studying the evolution of pheromone communication in insects. Cerambycids are economically and ecologically important, but little is known of their natural history, the role of volatile pheromones, or of phylogenetic relationships within the family.

Nanomaterials have played an important role in the advances: they have served as model systems to explore nanoscale physics and as building blocks to develop nanoscale tools and devices. The rational applications of nanomaterials require understanding of their fundamental properties. Early studies of nanomaterials---characterization of individual nanomaterials (e.g., carbon nanotubes)---have mostly focused on their basic mechanical and electrical properties. Most of these studies have relied on tools and methods rooted in solid-state physics, such as electron microscopes, scanning probe microscopes, and microfabricated testing devices; thus, the tools and methods were difficult to incorporate &quot;soft&quot; materials, rooted in chemistry and biology, into the studies. Despite enormous potential of technologies that integrate nanomaterials (more generally, nanotechnology and the physical sciences) and &quot;soft&quot; materials (more generally, chemical and biological systems), the basic knowledge of how &quot;hard&quot; nanomaterials interact with &quot;soft&quot; materials and how to interface &quot;inorganic&quot; nanomaterials with &quot;organic&quot; biomolecules and living biological systems was lacking.In this dissertation, we studied the interfaces and interactions of &quot;hard&quot; nanomaterials and &quot;soft&quot; materials, from fluids to living biological cells, at the nanoscale and presented a new concept to interface nanomaterials with living biological systems for biological and biophysical studies inside living cells at the nanoscale. In the first part, we present the study of how fluids interact with nanomaterials and how fluids behave at very small length scales, using nanotubes as model systems. In the second part, we present the development of nanotechnology-based tools for single cell studies at the nanoscale: single nanotube-based needle nanoprobes for biological and chemical sensing and high-precision nanoscale delivery methods for biological and biophysical studies inside living cells.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29174410", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72230"]}, {"authors": ["Kraus, William Lee"], "title": "Regulation of progesterone receptor expression and activity in uterine cells: Analysis of the molecular actions of estrogens and progestins on the progesterone receptor gene", "description": "Estrogens and progestins play important roles in many aspects of female reproductive biology. These hormones exert their effects via intracellular protein receptors, termed estrogen receptors (ERs) and progestin receptors (PRs). We have examined the regulation of PR levels in the rat uterus by estrogens and progestins, as well as the molecular mechanisms through which these hormones act. Our studies have shown that estradiol $\\rm (E\\sb2)$ causes rapid time- and dose-dependent increases in uterine PR mRNA and protein when administered to immature rats in vivo. These $\\rm E\\sb2$-mediated effects were reduced by cotreatment with progesterone or antiestrogen. To better define the molecular mechanisms controlling the $\\rm E\\sb2$-mediated effects, we cloned and characterized the $5\\sp\\prime$-region of the rat PR gene, including two functionally distinct promoters which were stimulated differently by $\\rm E\\sb2$, as well as by cyclic AMP (cAMP) through an ER-dependent mechanism. In subsequent studies, we identified and characterized a complex estrogen-responsive unit (ERU) in the rat PR gene, comprised of at least five different regions of the gene. The organization of the ERU was unique and defined a novel paradigm for the composition of a steroid hormone-responsive unit (SRU). Finally, we examined the ability of ligand-occupied PR to repress ER-mediated transcriptional activity at the gene level as a possible mechanism by which progesterone inhibits $\\rm E\\sb2$ stimulation of the rat PR gene. In our studies, the repression was demonstrable, and the magnitude of the repression varied depending on the PR isoform, PR levels, ligand type (i.e. agonist or antagonist), ligand concentration, promoter context and cell type, as well as the composition of the SRU. Together, these studies have helped to elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms mediating regulation of PR gene expression in rat uterine tissue by estrogen, progesterone and cAMP.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/4828410", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/19987"]}, {"authors": ["Reno, Hilary Elizabeth Lee"], "title": "An Ecological, Molecular, and Biochemical Comparison of Aedes Triseriatus (Say), the Vector of LaCrosse Virus, With Its Sibling Species, Aedes Hendersoni Cockerell", "description": "135 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2000.Aedes triseriatus (Say) is the primary vector of LaCrosse virus (LAC virus) that causes encephalitis in humans and especially young children. Aedes hendersoni Cockerell, a sibling species of Ae. triseriatus, is generally unable to transmit the virus because of a salivary gland escape barrier. Because the cycle of LAC virus is dependent on the ecology of its vector, the ecological studies of my thesis monitored oviposition activity for two consecutive years in two locations in an endemic area and one location in a non-endemic area of LAC virus. All sites had peaks in oviposition activity in July, one month prior to the peak incidence time of LAC encephalitis. The molecular studies of my thesis examined the sequences of the spacer regions in the ribosomal DNA loci of the Triseriatus group and constructed a phylogeny, of multiple clones from each species. The monophyly of the clones from some Ae. triseriatus and Ae. hendersoni individuals was supported by bootstrap values, but some clones from Ae. hendersoni Illinois and Colorado individuals did not cluster with regard to individual or population. This indicated that similar sequences are found among individuals of a species, even in different geographical populations of a species. Because the salivary glands of a vector are important to pathogen transmission, the biochemical studies of my thesis identified the apyrase, an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, of Ae. triseriatus and Ae. hendersoni . Apyrase activity was characterized from both species, but no difference in activities was observed. Some differences in apyrase levels after a blood meal were detected between Ae. triseriatus and Aedes aegypti L. (Rockefeller strain). These differences may explain why LAC encephalitis cases occur sporadically. The ecological, molecular, and biochemical relationships of Ae. triseriatus and  Ae. hendersoni are an important factors in understanding the evolution of their infection with LAC virus and the barriers to the virus that have been described within the mosquitoes. By appreciating the importance that vector biology plays in the LAC cycle, we can identify risk factors for infection, improve the prediction of outbreaks of LAC encephalitis, optimize methods of mosquito control, and develop methods of interfering with the arbovirus cycle in mosquitoes.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158309531", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/86486"]}, {"authors": ["Tanner, Kandice Danielle"], "title": "Cat-ology spectrally resolved neurophotonics in the mammalian brain and phantom studies", "description": "Physicists provide significant contributions to the field of Biology and Medical Sciences\r\nby applying basic physics principles to the field.

The identification of four calmodulin (CaM) isoforms in Arabidopsis provides a good opportunity to address this fundamental question. The goal of this research was to address whether CaM isoforms confer specificity to Ca$\\sp{2+}$-mediated signal transduction pathways. A combination of in vitro biochemical enzyme activation and molecular biological approaches were employed to tackle this question. First, CaM isoforms produced from E. coli expression systems were used to test their abilities to activate pea NAD kinase. There was a small, but significant difference among the CaM isoforms' ability to activate pea NAD kinase in vitro. Minor differences in K$\\sb{0.5}$, but not V$\\sb{\\rm max}$, were observed between CaM isoforms and chimeric proteins tagged at their N-termini with a 12-residue c-myc epitope. Nonsense mutations of the C-terminal 7 residues of CaM-6 (CaM-6M), however, drastically impaired the ability of the protein to activate NAD kinase. The requirement for free Ca$\\sp{2+}$ to activate NAD kinase by wt and mutant CaM-6 proteins was identical. In contrast, CaM-6M bound synthetic peptide substrates with lower apparent affinity than CaM-6. Because of the importance of NAD kinase as a model system for studying CaM structure and function relationships, a systematic series of experiments were performed to purify NAD kinase with the goal of obtaining direct amino acid sequence information. The method reported here yielded higher purity of the enzyme ($\\sim$5000 fold) with enhanced enzyme stability than any previously published methods. Methods of detecting CaM-binding proteins (CaM-BPs) were optimized by conjugating several reporter molecules CaM. The feasibilities of conjugates as ligand probes for detecting CaM-BPs in protein fractions after separation in SDS-PAGE and in screening cDNA expression library were evaluated. Thirty-two clones encoding putative CaM-BPs were isolated from an Arabidopsis flower library. Eighteen clones were partially sequenced. Data base comparisons revealed that some of the sequences shared significant homology with enzymes involved in cell division, phospholipid signaling and other cellular process.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291719131", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/23354"]}, {"authors": ["Lu, Deyu"], "title": "Empirical Nanotube Model: Applications to Water Channels and Nano-Oscillators", "description": "Carbon nanotubes are building blocks of the fast-developing nanotechnology that leads to revolutionary breakthroughs in material science and engineering.

In particular, nanobiotechnology, a synergy of nanotechnology and biology, aims at characterizing, building, and utilizing nano-devices to benefit human health as well as employ life forms for technical purposes.

Special emphasis is placed on an accurate and efficient description of the electrostatics of nanotubes, which plays a key role in\r\ndetermining molecular transport dynamics through nanotubes. In the proposed model, atomic partial charges are calculated from a quantum chemistry approach, and the polarizability of the nanotube is modeled through a self-consistent tight-binding method. The suitability of the model is demonstrated through studies of a nanotube water channel and a K+-nanotube complex. It is found in the former case that atomic partial charges on the tube edges greatly contribute to the total interaction energy, while the polarization of the nanotube lowers the electrostatic energy once\r\na water molecule moves inside the nanotube. In the latter case, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations reveal that a K+ ion induces a strong dielectric response in the nanotube wall, which helps to trap the ion inside the tube and force the ion to oscillate at a terahertz\r\nfrequency. Such a nano-oscillator may hold potential applications as a room temperature terahertz wave detector.U of I Onlythesis/dissertatio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text", "moving image", "dissertation/thesis"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291726478", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/31390"]}, {"authors": ["Carpenter, John Halsey"], "title": "History Induced Critical Scaling in Disordered Media and Super Diffusive Growth in Highly Advective Random Environments", "description": "The behavior of non-equilibrium systems in the presence of quenched random\r\ndisorder is studied.

Inorganic LEDs have advantages over organic LEDs widely used today, such as better efficiency and lifetime. Thin-film GaN structure was grown on sapphire substrate, which gives excellent optical characteristics. To obtain high performance, a high-temperature process (i.e., 500 \u00baC) for ohmic contacts was performed on sapphire substrate. After In-Pd alloy bonding with silicon wafer and exposing the sapphire and GaN interface to a KrF or YAG, the GaN layer is lifted off from the sapphire substrate and now can be picked up and transferred to a foreign substrate, such as glass, plastic, or rubber. LEDs fabricated via this technique show high efficiency and luminescence compared to LEDs fabricated on silicon. Using this technique, we demonstrate a flexible array of micro-size GaN LEDs, which have strong applications in biology and other multiple areas.unpublishednot peer reviewedU of I OnlyUndergraduate senior thesis not recommended for open acces", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text", "other"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291740898", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/46549"]}, {"authors": ["Brown, Roger Keith"], "title": "Increasing Competence in Self-Directed Learning: An Exploratory Study in the Teaching of Biology", "description": "152 p.Thesis (Educat.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1966.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291752852", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/59256"]}, {"authors": ["Melin, Brian Edward"], "title": "The Developmental Biology of Euplectrus Platyhypenae Howard (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), a Parasitoid of Pseudaletia Unipuncta (Haw.)

Understanding how these complexes behave at interfaces, as well as controlling their structure, is of fundamental interest to science and technology. Lipoproteins, a complex of protein and lipid, serve as the primary transporter of cholesterol and other lipids throughout the body. There is a direct correlation between the presence of certain lipoprotein species and the incidence of coronary artery disease. High density lipoproteins are responsible for the removal of cholesterol from the peripheral tissues and, as such, lead to a reduction in the risk of heart disease.Reconstituted high density lipoproteins have been studied with the atomic force microscope. This microscope has revealed new insight into the structure of these supramolecular aggregates and their interfacial behavior. In order to allow accurate quantitation of lateral size a new imaging standard was developed. This standard, peptide modified colloidal gold, has been used in solution to solve tip induced artifacts and to correct for tip changes simultaneous with sample imaging. A spontaneous fusion process has been observed and examined, revealing the important structural role of apolipoprotein A-I, even in an interfacial setting.These discoidal rHDL have been found to generate a new form of supported bilayer structure which has been particulary amenable to atomic force microscope study and manipulation. The microscope has revealed the bilayer structure of these discs through nanodissection. It has also been used to control the spontaneous fusion process of these discs, resulting in spatially defined bilayer domains of nanometer scale dimensions. By using a source of exogenous lipid in solution the AFM has been used to induce lipid exchange with these surfaces, resulting in a compositional change of the supported bilayer in a spatially controlled manner. A model of this process has been proposed based on defects introduced by the AFM tip binding vesicles, which subsequently fuse with the surface. Finally, the AFM has been used to direct proteins to spatially selected regions, allowing the fabrication of heterogeneous membrane protein containing surfaces.In separate studies, myoglobin has been used to study the fluorescence lifetime behavior of oriented biomolecular surfaces. These studies have revealed differences in lifetime between differentially oriented myoglobin molecules, consistent with differential accessibility of the heme pocket to quenching by oxygen. A computational study of the dependence of linear dichroism on the distribution of protein orientation angle has revealed a constrained degenerate solution, which has impact on all attempts to describe protein orientation with this technique.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291769532", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/77479"]}, {"authors": ["Chen, Zhilei"], "title": "Protein Engineering via in Vitro Coevolution", "description": "138 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2006.The creation of novel protein functions represents a significant challenge in protein engineering. To address this challenge, I have developed a simple and efficient method---in vitro coevolution---for the creation of novel protein functions in an existing protein scaffold. The in vitro coevolution method involves the design of a hypothetical pathway toward the target protein function followed by stepwise directed evolution of an appropriate protein scaffold along the pathway. As proof of concept, I have applied this strategy to the engineering of two proteins. In the first example, in vitro coevolution was used to engineer variants of the human estrogen receptor a ligand binding domain (hERalphaLBD) with novel corticosterone activity. A yeast two hybrid system based high throughput selection/screening method was developed to assay the transactivation activity of hERalphaLBD. Two steroidal ligands---testosterone and progesterone---that provide a progressive structural bridge between the natural ligand 17beta-estradiol and the target ligand corticosterone, were chosen to assist the directed evolution of hERalphaLBD. A total of approximately 106 randomly point-mutated variants were phenotypically screened in four rounds of directed evolution, resulting in two hERalphaLBD variants that respond to corticosterone. In the second example, in vitro coevolution was used to the engineer variants of homing endonuclease I-SceI with novel DNA cleavage activity. Homing endonucleases have great potential for applications such as targeted gene correction in gene therapy and gene alteration in systems biology and metabolic engineering. However, the limited repertoire of recognition sequences in naturally available homing endonucleases severely hampers their usefulness. I have developed a highly sensitive selection method for the directed evolution of homing endonucleases that couples enzymatic DNA cleavage with the survival of host cells. Using this selection method and in vitro evolution, I attempted to engineer I-SceI variants that can selectively cleave a target sequence found in a mutant transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene involved in cystic fibrosis. So far, I have successfully completed two rounds of directed evolution toward the first intermediate target sequence, and obtained a variant that has 5000 fold increased activity toward the new target sequence compared to the wild type enzyme.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291776989", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/85452"]}, {"authors": ["Zelin, Elena"], "title": "Deoxyribozyme-Mediated Synthesis of Branched Nucleic Acids and Application to Modulation of Ribozyme Catalysis", "description": "155 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2008.Deoxyribozymes are single-stranded DNA molecules that catalyze a variety of chemical reactions. Catalytic DNAs have not been found in nature but can be identified by in vitro selection from random sequences. In this thesis, deoxyribozymes that ligate two RNA substrates or attach DNA to RNA are identified and characterized. These studies have been useful for understanding fundamental aspects of nucleic acid catalysis and for providing practical reagents.Ribozymes are RNA molecules that possess catalytic activity. In order to perform their functions, RNA molecules must fold into specific three-dimensional structures. RNA folding landscapes are very rugged, and RNA molecules have a strong tendency to form transient metastable conformations that represent local minima on the RNA folding landscape. In nature, these misfolded states can represent kinetic traps in which RNA molecules remain for some time before they fold correctly. One of our goals is to gain fundamental understanding of RNA folding pathways through the use of the DNA constraint strategy, in which two attached complementary DNA strands form a duplex that can be used as a structural constraint to control RNA conformation. In an initial study, we employed the DNA constraint strategy to control the catalytic activity of a small self-cleaving catalytic RNA, the hammerhead ribozyme. To prepare the DNA-modified hammerhead ribozyme, we used in vitro selection to identify the 9FQ4 deoxyribozyme that allows attachment of DNA to RNA at branch-site adenosine in high yield and with useful generality. We showed that when two complementary DNA strands were attached by 9FQ4 at two distinct positions of cis or trans hammerhead ribozyme constructs, the ribozyme catalytic activity was substantially diminished. Subsequent addition of free DNA oligonucleotide that was complementary to one of the constraint strands or addition of DNase I restored the high catalytic activity of the ribozyme. In contrast, attachment of two non-complementary strands at the same positions had only a modest effect on catalysis. Experiments using RNase T2 demonstrated that the secondary structure of the ribozyme was intact, indicating that the tertiary structure was affected by the DNA constraint.We have also used the 9FQ4 deoxyribozyme to attach DNA strands to the large multi-domain L-21 ScaI ribozyme form of the Tetrahymena group I intron. DNA strands were placed at seven pairs of target sites. Similar to the results obtained for the hammerhead ribozyme, when the two attached DNA strands were complementary, ribozyme catalysis was nearly completely abolished. Activity was restored to the wild-type level after separation of the constraint strands by addition of free complementary DNA. Together, the data obtained for the hammerhead and group I intron ribozymes validate the DNA constraint approach to create kinetically stable discrete misfolded states of RNAs. We anticipate that further studies using these DNA-constrained RNAs will contribute to our fundamental knowledge of RNA molecular biology.Adenosine is the conserved nucleotide at the branch site in most pre-mRNA introns, where its 2'-hydroxyl group acts as a nucleophile for the first step of splicing. The 7S11 deoxyribozyme also forms its branched RNA product by mediating the nucleophilic attack of a 2'-hydroxyl of an internal adenosine on a 5'-triphosphate. Because the branch-site adenosine used by 7S11 was not predetermined by the selection design, it is not clear whether this preference is an inherent chemical characteristic of forming branched RNA or a coincidental outcome of the particular selection experiment. To explore this, we designed a new in vitro selection experiment based on the three-helix-junction structural format of 7S11, but provided branch-site uridine during the selection process. The resulting deoxyribozymes had a substantial preference for a branch-site adenosine, although adenosine was never available during the selection itself. This suggests a chemical basis for nature's choice of the branch-site nucleotide.Finally, we intend to study the role that divalent metal ions play in the phosphoryl transfer reaction during RNA splicing by group II introns. To enable these studies, in vitro selection was initiated to identify deoxyribozymes that mediate the nucleophilic attack of an internal free 3'-OH and also tolerate sulfur substitution of the 2'-oxygen at the branch-site adenosine. The selection efforts instead produced a collection of deoxyribozymes that utilize alternative internal nucleotides as branch sites for ligation.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291765847", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72337"]}, {"authors": ["Yu, Yan"], "title": "Dynamics and Structures of Phospholipid Assemblies", "description": "113 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2009.This thesis studies structures and dynamics of phospholipids vesicles and their interactions with nanoparticles and peptides, with a focus on the following problems: (1) Single-vesicle dynamics for new colloidal physics.

By controlling the direction of flagella rotation, this process allows the organism to sense changes in its surroundings and migrate toward more favorable environments. The process of chemotaxis is controlled by the activity of an autophosphorylating histidine kinase, CheA. The work described in this thesis shows that Bacillus subtilis CheA differs from other members of this family of bacterial histidine kinases in two respects: it is able to achieve its maximum phosphorylation potential at very low ATP concentrations, and the phosphorylated form of the enzyme is very stable in the presence of ADP and other potential phosphoryl group acceptors. We have long hypothesized that attractant-bound methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) in B. subtilis increase the activity of CheA. Asparagine-bound McpB has been shown here to increase CheA activity in vitro, the first example of activation of a two-component signal transducing kinase by its proposed environmental ligand to date. Studies on the enteric chemotaxis system revealed that taxis toward certain sugars is mediated solely through a separate phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS), involved in sugar transport. In B. subtilis, we have determined that taxis toward PTS carbohydrates is mediated both by MCPs and the PTS. Finally, a restriction map of the distal end of the 26kb fla/che operon has been deduced, which will be of value in attempts to clone additional chemotaxis genes in B. subtilis.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291716661", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/20879"]}, {"authors": ["Fang, Hong"], "title": "Molecular biology studies on thecyd operon of Escherichia coli", "description": "The Cytochrome d terminal oxidase complex is one of two terminal oxidases in the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli.

The thesis research described here is focused on further characterization of the cyd gene locus and on the structure/function relationship of the cytochrome d complex. Deletion and insertion analyses combined with in vitro coupled transcription and translation studies indicate that cyd is a two-cistron operon with the subunit I gene upstream of the subunit II gene. S1 nuclease mapping experiments were used to show that the initiation of transcription occurs at $-$287 bases upstream of the start codon of the subunit I gene. In order to define the heme binding sites, each of ten histidine residues within the two subunits were converted to other amino acids using site-directed mutagenesis. Spectroscopic studies and catalytic assays strongly suggest that his19 and his186 within subunit I are essential for heme binding and oxidase activity. His186 is an axial ligand for cytochrome $b\\sb{558}$. His19 is an axial ligand for either cytochrome d or $b\\sb{595}$. It is difficult to distinguish between these two hemes because the binding of the two hemes are always cooperative. These models are confirmed by revertant analyses.

All mating pairs were found at the interface of the Mediterranean Outflow Water with North Atlantic Deep Water, suggesting that environmental parameters associated with the interface of these water masses may be relevant for mating in this species. The majority of C. affinis was mating which is an indication of synchrony and reproductive seasonality. A biennial female reproductive cycle is hypothesized, involving molting and mating in the first year with subsequent oviposition during the autumn, and spawning during spring of the second year. We suggest that synchrony and seasonality in the reproduction of C. affinis is linked to the formation of phytoplankton blooms in surface waters, with females carrying embryos from autumn to spring, possibly timing the release of planktotrophic larvae to exploit a seasonal peak in surface productivity and its export", "doi": "10.1016/j.dsr2.2013.01.021", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["article"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/32243261", "http://hdl.handle.net/10773/13477"]}, {"authors": ["Domingues, C.

The aim of this thesis is to contribute to a better understanding of the\r\nmechanisms of toxicity of this element, exploring some aspects of the bioinorganic\r\nchemistry of chromium.\r\nChapters 1 and 2 are a review of some aspects of the chemistry of chromium and\r\nof some of its biological reductants, which may also act as potential ligands after\r\nchromium reduction.\r\nIn Chapter, 3 the kinetics of Cr(V1) reduction processes by thiol containing\r\nreductants is described. In particular, reduction reactions of Cr(V1) by glutathione,\r\ncysteine or penicillamine were studied using several spectroscopic techniques. New data\r\ntreatment methods were applied to the reduction reaction by glutathione (considering it as\r\nhaving a biphasic behaviour). Fast kinetic methods were utilised in the Cr(V1) reduction\r\nreactions by cysteine and penicillamine. All these studies allowed the identification and\r\ncharacterisation of thioester intermediates formed during reduction, as well as their\r\nformation and decomposition kinetics. Results support new arguments in favour of the\r\nattribution of a certain type of mechanism to those reactions. Raman spectroscopy was\r\napplied to study structural aspects of the thioester intermediates, under physiological\r\nconditions. This Chapter deals also with the identification and kinetics of formation of\r\nfinal Cr(II1) products obtained from Cr(V1) reduction reactions with cysteine,\r\npenicillamine and glutathione.\r\nChapter 4 describes the syntheses and the characterisation of Cr(II1) complexes\r\nwith cysteine, penicillamine and thiomalic acid. Hydrolysis kinetic results for the two\r\nfirst complexes are discussed. Surprisingly, the hydrolysis rate constants are abnormally\r\nhigh, even if considering the unusual labile behaviour of Cr(II1) complexes containing\r\nCr-S bonds. Their behaviour in an non-aqueous solution (DMF) was also studied.\r\nBecause of found contradictions in the attribution of absolute configurations to\r\nCr(II1) complexes with the simplest aminoacids this subject was reviewed in Chapter 5.\r\nSome of this type complexes were prepared and a new compound with L-valine was\r\nsynthesised and its crystal structure determined by single-crystai X-Ray diffraction\r\nmethods. Mass spectrometry with ionisation by fast atom bombardment was applied for\r\nthe first time to these Cr(II1) complexes with a-aminocarboxilic acids, in order to solve\r\nambiguities in the interpretation of spectroscopic results (DC). Successful results allowed\r\nthe identification of five new structures, mainly dimeric-type.\r\nIn Chapter 6, results from the interaction of Cr(I1I) compounds with calf thymus\r\nisolated nucleic are presented. Because of the unusual uptake of the compounds\r\ncontaining Cr-S bonds, the results obtained open new perspectives into the interpretation\r\nof the mechanisms and of the biological role of chromium compounds in +3 oxidation\r\nstate.\r\nIn Chapter 7, at last, experimental methods and conditions concerning the results\r\npresented in the previous chapters are described in detail", "publisher": "Universidade de Aveiro", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/95445375.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/95445375.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/95445375", "http://hdl.handle.net/10773/18280"]}, {"authors": ["Boursali, Amin", "Guen-Bouazza, Ahlam", "Sayah, Choukria"], "title": "DC and RF characteristics of 20 nm gate length InAlAs/InGaAs/InP HEMTs for high frequency application", "description": "lnAlAs/lnGaAs/InP high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) offers excellent high frequency operation.In this work,the DC and RF performance of a 20 nm gate length enhancement mode InAlAs/InGaAs/InP high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) on InP substrate are presented.The SILVACO-TCAD simulations performed at room temperature using the appropriate model sshowed that the studied device exhibit excellent pinch-off characteristics, with a maximum transconductance of 1100ms/mm, a threshold voltage of   0,62V, and an Ion/Ioff ratio of 2.106.

Finally, in order to visualize damaged areas, the Canny operator is used to extract the edge of the damage. In the experiment, ground tests are used to simulate hypervelocity impacts in space. Historical data of natural damaged material and artificial damaged material are used to build different classifiers.

Our goal is to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of the states and parameters given noisy observations of the output of the hidden Markov model. We consider three problems, namely, (i) determining the PDF of the states in a non-linear HMM using sequential MCMC techniques, (ii) determining the parameters of discretized linear, ordinary differential equations (ODE) given noisy observations of the solutions and\n(iii) Determining the PDF of the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation when the parameters of the ODE are random variables. While these problems naturally arise in several areas in engineering, this thesis is motivated by potential applications in bio-mechanics. One of the interesting research questions that is being considered by some researchers is whether the formation of clots can be predicted by observing the mechanical properties of arteries, such as their stiff ness. In order for this approach to be successful, it is critical to estimate the stiffness of arteries based on noisy measurements of their mechanical response. The parameters of these models can then be used to differentiate diseased arteries from healthy ones or, the parameters can be used to predict the probability of formation of plaques. From experimental data, we would like to infer the posterior density of the states and parameters (such as stiffness), and classify it as being healthy or diseased.

Traditionally, assembly using a top-down robotic approach has been well-studied and applied to micro-electronics and MEMS industries, but less so in nanotechnology. With the bloom of nanotechnology ever since the 1990s, newly designed products with new materials, coatings and nanoparticles are gradually entering everyone\u2019s life, while the industry has grown into a billion-dollar volume worldwide. Traditionally, nanotechnology products are assembled using bottom-up methods, such as self-assembly, rather than with top-down robotic assembly. This is due to considerations of volume handling of large quantities of components, and the high cost associated to top-down manipulation with the required precision. However, the bottom-up manufacturing methods have certain limitations, such as components need to have pre-define shapes and surface coatings, and the number of assembly components is limited to very few. For example, in the case of self-assembly of nano-cubes with origami design, post-assembly manipulation of cubes in large quantities and cost-efficiency is still challenging. In this thesis, we envision a new paradigm for nano scale assembly, realized with the help of a wafer-scale microfactory containing large numbers of MEMS microrobots. These robots will work together to enhance the throughput of the factory, while their cost will be reduced when compared to conventional nano positioners. To fulfill the microfactory vision, numerous challenges related to design, power, control and nanoscale task completion by these microrobots must be overcome. In this work, we study three types of microrobots for the microfactory: a world\u2019s first laser-driven micrometer-size locomotor called ChevBot\uff0ca stationary millimeter-size robotic arm, called Solid Articulated Four Axes Microrobot (sAFAM), and a light-powered centimeter-size crawler microrobot called SolarPede. The ChevBot can perform autonomous navigation and positioning on a dry surface with the guidance of a laser beam. The sAFAM has been designed to perform nano positioning in four degrees of freedom, and nanoscale tasks such as indentation, and manipulation.

New Zealand has faced dramatic changes in tertiary education over the past 20 years, particularly in the vocational education and training (VET) sector.

In these problems, each agent $k$ collects and learns from its own local data and is able to communicate with its local neighbors. While each single node in the network may not  be capable of sophisticated behavior on its own, the agents collaborate to solve large-scale and challenging learning problems.\tDifferent approaches have been proposed in the literature to boost the learning capabilities of networked agents. Among these approaches, the class of diffusion strategies has been shown to be particularly well-suited due to their enhanced stability range over other methods and improved performance in adaptive scenarios. However, diffusion implementations suffer from a small inherent bias in the iterates. When a constant step-size is employed to solve deterministic optimization problems, the iterates generated by the diffusion strategy will converge to a small neighborhood around the desired global solution but not to the exact solution itself. This bias is not due to any gradient noise arising from stochastic approximation; it is instead due to the update structure in diffusion implementations. The existence of the bias leads to three questions: (1) What is the origin of this inherent bias? (2) Can it be eliminated? (3) Does the correction of the bias bring benefits to distributed optimization, distributed adaptation, or distributed learning?This dissertation provides affirmative solutions to these questions. Specifically, we design a new {\\em exact diffusion} approach that eliminates the inherent bias in diffusion. Exact diffusion has almost the same structure as diffusion, with the addition of a ``correction'' step between the adaptation and combination steps. Next, this dissertation studies the performance of exact diffusion for the scenarios of distributed optimization, distributed adaptation, and distributed learning, respectively. For distributed optimization, exact diffusion is proven to converge exponentially fast to the {\\em exact} global solution under proper conditions. For distributed adaptation, exact diffusion is proven to have better steady-state mean-square-error than diffusion, and this superiority is analytically shown to be more evident for sparsely-connected networks such as line, cycle, grid, and other topologies. In distributed learning, exact diffusion can be integrated with the amortized variance-reduced gradient method (AVRG) so that it converges exponentially fast to the exact global solution while employing stochastic gradients per iteration.

Despite receiving government funding, drop-out continues to increase. An understanding of perceived factors influencing drop-out rate would help to develop and deploy retention strategy for FET college students. Previous studies on drop-out shows that students that have dropped out are more likely to be unemployed and living in poverty compared to those students that have successfully completed their programmes. In 2006 the Minister of Labour declared that FET Colleges in South Africa have a major role to play in assisting youth in gaining skills and thereby halving poverty and the unemployment rate by the year 2014. This declaration highlights the importance of FET colleges and amplifies the need for a strategy to maximise students\u2019 retention and minimise drop-out rate.

It is challenging, but recently, there have been significant performance improvements using deep learning approaches. In this article, we propose efficient module based single image SR networks (EMBSR) and tackle multiple SR problems in NTIRE 2018 challenge by recycling trained networks. Our proposed EMBSR allowed us to reduce training time with effectively deeper networks, to use modular ensemble for improved performance, and to separate subproblems for better erformance.\n\nWe also proposed EDSR-PP, an improved version of previous ESDR by incorporating pyramid pooling so that global as well as local context information can be utilized. Lastly, we proposed a novel denoising / deblurring residual convolutional network (DnResNet) using residual block and batch normalization. Our proposed EMBSR with DnResNet demonstrated that multiple SR problems can be tackled efficiently and e ectively by winning the 2nd place for Track 2 and the 3rd place for Track 3. Our proposed method with EDSR-PP also achieved the ninth place for Track 1 with the fastest run time among top nine teams.clos", "datePublished": "2019-08-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Graduate School of UNIST", "subjects": ["Master's thesis"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/232184148.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/232184148.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/232184148", "http://unist.dcollection.net/common/orgView/200000223902", "https://scholarworks.unist.ac.kr/handle/201301/27665"]}, {"authors": ["Meng, Xiaoxiao", "Zhou, Niancheng", "Wang, Qianggang", "Guerrero, Josep M."], "title": "A Nonlinear, Bounded and Lipchitz Continuous Distributed Active Power Sharing Control Method for Islanded AC Microgrids", "datePublished": "2019-02-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900172", "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "subjects": ["article"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/304615855.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/304615855.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/304615855", "https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/308298864/08648177.pdf", "http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=85065167329&partnerID=8YFLogxK", "https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900172", "https://vbn.aau.dk/da/publications/d7692613-a0dd-4940-8030-ee5f2f14242c"]}, {"authors": ["Thevampalayam Kaliappan, Anandalakshmi"], "title": "Policy-based power consumption management in smart energy community using single agent and multi agent Q learning algorithms", "description": "Power consumption in residential sector has increased due to growing population, economic growth, invention of many electrical appliances and therefore is becoming a growing concern in the power industry. Managing power consumption in residential sector without sacrificing user comfort has become one of the main research areas recently. The complexity of the power system keeps growing due to the penetration of alternative sources of electric energy such as solar plant, Hydro, Biomass, Geothermal and wind farm to meet the growing demand for electricity. To overcome the challenges due to complexity, the power grid needs to be intelligent in all aspects. As the grid gets smarter and smarter, considerable efforts are being undertaken to make the houses and businesses smarter in consuming the electrical energy to minimize and level the electricity demand which is also known as Demand Side Management (DSM). It also necessitates that the conventional way of modelling, control and energy management in all sectors needs to be enhanced or replaced by intelligent information processing techniques. In our research work, it has been done in several stages.\r\n(Purpose of Study and Results) We proposed a policy-based framework which allows intelligent and flexible energy management of home appliances in a smart home which is complex and dynamic in ways that saves energy automatically. We considered the challenges in formalizing the behaviour of the appliances using their states and managing the energy consumption using policies. Policies are rules which are created and edited by a house agent to deal with situations or power problems that are likely to occur. Each time the power problem arises the house agent will refer to policy and one or a set of rules will be executed to overcome that situation. Our policy-based smart home can manage energy efficiently and can significantly participate in reducing peak energy demand (thereby may reduce carbon emission). Our proposed policy-based framework achieves peak shaving so that power consumption adapts to available power, while ensuring the comfort level of the inhabitants and taking device characteristics in to account. Our simulation results on MATLAB indicate that the proposed Policy driven homes can effectively contribute to Demand side power management by decreasing the peak hour usage of the appliances and can efficiently manage energy in a smart home in a user-friendly way.\r\nWe propounded and developed peak demand management algorithms for a Smart Energy Community using different types of coordination mechanisms for coordination of multiple house agents working in the same environment. These algorithms use centralized model, decentralized model, hybrid model and Pareto resource allocation model for resource allocation. We modelled user comfort for the appliance based on user preference, the power reduction capability and the important activities that run around the house associated with that appliance. Moreover, we compared these algorithms with respect to their peak reduction capability, overall comfort of the community, simplicity of the algorithm and community involvement and finally able to find the best performing algorithm among them. Our simulation results show that the proposed coordination algorithms can effectively reduce peak demand while maintaining user comfort. With the help of our proposed algorithms, the demand for electricity of a smart community can be managed intelligently and sustainably. This work is not only aiming for peak reduction management it aims for achieving it while keeping the comfort level of the inhabitants is minimum. It can learn user\u2019s behaviour and establish the set of optimal rules dynamically. If the available power to a house is kept at a certain level the house agent will learn to use this notional power to operate all the appliances according to the requirements and comfort level of the household. This way the consumers are forced to use the power below the set level which can result in the over-all power consumption be maintained at a certain rate or level which means sustainability is possible or depletion of natural resources for electricity can be reduced.\r\nTemporal interactions of Energy Demand by local users and renewable energy sources can also be done more efficiently by having a set of new policy rules to switch between the utility and the renewable source of energy but it is beyond the scope of this thesis.\r\nWe applied Q learning techniques to a home energy management agent where the agent learns to find the optimal sequence of turning off appliances so that the appliances with higher priority will not be switched off during peak demand period or power consumption management. The policy-based home energy management determines the optimal policy at every instant dynamically by learning through the interaction with the environment using one of the reinforcement learning approaches called Q-learning. The Q-learning home power consumption problem formulation consisting of state space, actions and reward function is presented. The implications of these simulation results are that the proposed Q- learning based\r\npower consumption management is very effective and enables the users to have minimum discomfort during participation in peak demand management or at the time when power consumption management is essential when the available power is rationale.\r\nThis work is extended to a group of 10 houses and three multi agent Q- learning algorithms are proposed and developed for improving the individual and community comfort while at the same time keeping the power consumption below the available power level or electricity price below the set price. The proposed algorithms are weighted strategy sharing algorithm, concurrent Q learning algorithm and cooperative distributive learning algorithm. These proposed algorithms are coded and tested for managing power consumption of a group of 10 houses and the performance of all three algorithms with respect to power management and community comfort is studied and compared. Actual power consumption of a community and modified power consumption curves using Weighted Strategy Sharing algorithm, Concurrent learning and Distributive Q Learning and user comfort results are presented, and the results are analysed in this thesis", "datePublished": "2019-02-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "School of Electrical and Information Engineering", "subjects": ["Masters Thesis", "Master of Philosophy M.Phil"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/212696687.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/212696687.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/212696687", "http://hdl.handle.net/2123/19990"]}, {"authors": ["Chedid, Fouad B."], "title": "Kolmogorov Complexity and Information Content", "description": "In this paper, we revisit a central concept in Kolmogorov complexity in which\none would equate program-size complexity with information content.

CASE STUDY OF RWANDA STOCK EXCHANGE", "description": "Countries all over the world are generally concerned about the performance of the stock markets due to its greater contribution to financial stability of the country and by extension economic growth. Through trading in securities in the stock market, the country is able to mobilize savings and channel it to viable investment opportunities which ultimately lead to expansion of GDP. Several studies have been carried out in Rwanda regarding the stock market performance but none looked at the macroeconomic effects on stock market performance in Rwanda. The study analyzed the effects of exchange rate, GDP growth rate, inflation (CPI) and interest rate (KRR) on stock market performance measured by market capitalization. The study used monthly time series data for a period of 6 years. Engel Granger Cointegration tests were carried out to determine the long run relationship between the variables respectively. The study adopted VAR method in analyzing the effects of the above macroeconomic variables on stock market performance. This involved computing impulse response functions and Variance Decomposition Analysis. The findings indicated that GDP, inflation and exchange rate are negatively significant in affecting stock market performance while interest rate is negatively insignificant. The study recommended that public awareness campaign on the importance of RSE should be carried out, industrialization should be encouraged to avoid high importation, money supply should be regulated to reduce inflation, Key repo rate should be lowered to encourage more borrowing for investment. This study will be important to the government in encouraging more investments through growth of RSE hence employment creation. It\u2019s also important to the management of RSE more so to the policy analysis department in strategic decision making and offering advice to the relevant stakeholders towards achieving growth of securities market.

Cisco forecasts that the mobile data traffic growth will remain to increase and reach 49 Exabytes per month by 2021.\n\nHowever, the telecommunication service providers/operators face many challenges in order\n\nto improve cellular network capacity to match these ever-increasing data demands due to\n\nlow, almost flat Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and low Return on Investment (RoI).\n\nSpectrum resource crunch and licensing requirement for operation in cellular bands further\n\ncomplicate the procedure to support and manage the network.\n\nIn order to deal with the aforementioned challenges, one of the most vital solutions is\n\nto leverage the integration benefits of cellular networks with unlicensed operation of Wi-Fi\n\nnetworks. A closer level of cellular and Wi-Fi coupling/interworking improves Quality of\n\nService (QoS) by unified connection management to user devices (UEs). It also offloads\n\na significant portion of user traffic from cellular Base Station (BS) to Wi-Fi Access Point\n\n(AP). In this thesis, we have considered the cellular network to be Long Term Evolution\n\n(LTE) popularly known as 4G-LTE for interworking with Wi-Fi.\n\nThird Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) defined various LTE and Wi-Fi interworking architectures from Rel-8 to Rel-11. Because of the limitations in these legacy LTE\n\nWi-Fi interworking solutions, 3GPP proposed Radio Level Integration (RLI) architectures\n\nto enhance flow mobility and to react fast to channel dynamics. RLI node encompasses link\n\nlevel connection between Small cell \n\ndeployments, (ii) Meeting Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) requirements of the users including\n\nthose experiencing poor Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR), and (iii) Dynamic\n\nsteering of the flows across LTE and Wi-Fi links to maximize the system throughput.\n\nThe second important problem addressed is the uplink traffic steering. To enable efficient uplink traffic steering in LWIP system, in this thesis, Network Coordination Function\n\n(NCF) is proposed. NCF is realized at the LWIP node by implementing various uplink traffic steering algorithms. NCF encompasses four different uplink traffic steering algorithms\n\nfor efficient utilization of Wi-Fi resources in LWIP system. NCF facilitates the network to\n\ntake intelligent decisions rather than individual UEs deciding to steer the uplink traffic onto\n\nLTE link or Wi-Fi link. The NCF algorithms work by leveraging the availability of LTE as\n\nthe anchor to improvise the channel utilization of Wi-Fi.\n\nThe third most important problem is to enable packet level steering in LWIP. When\n\ndata rates of LTE and Wi-Fi links are incomparable, steering packets across the links create\n\nproblems for TCP traffic. When the packets are received Out-of-Order (OOO) at the TCP\n\nreceiver due to variation in delay experienced on each link, it leads to the generation of\n\nDUPlicate ACKnowledgements (DUP-ACK). These unnecessary DUP-ACKs adversely affect the TCP congestion window growth and thereby lead to poor TCP performance. This\n\nthesis addresses this problem by proposing a virtual congestion control mechanism (VIrtual\n\ncongeStion control wIth Boost acknowLedgEment -VISIBLE). The proposed mechanism\n\nnot only improves the throughput of a flow by reducing the number of unnecessary DUPACKs delivered to the TCP sender but also sends Boost ACKs in order to rapidly grow the\n\ncongestion window to reap in aggregation benefits of heterogeneous links.\n\nThe fourth problem considered is the placement of LWIP nodes. In this thesis, we have\n\naddressed problems pertaining to the dense deployment of LWIP nodes. LWIP deployment\n\ncan be realized in colocated and non-colocated fashion. The placement of LWIP nodes is\n\ndone with the following objectives: (i) Minimizing the number of LWIP nodes deployed\n\nwithout any coverage holes, (ii) Maximizing SINR in every sub-region of a building, and\n\n(iii) Minimizing the energy spent by UEs and LWIP nodes.\n\nFinally, prototypes of RLI architectures are presented (i.e., LWIP and LWA testbeds).\n\nThe prototypes are developed using open source LTE platform OpenAirInterface (OAI) and\n\ncommercial-off-the-shelf hardware components. The developed LWIP prototype is made to\n\nwork with commercial UE (Nexus 5). The LWA prototype requires modification at the UE\n\nprotocol stack, hence it is realized using OAI-UE. The developed prototypes are coupled\n\nwith the legacy multipath protocol such as MPTCP to investigate the coupling benefits", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmr.2018.06.006", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/187763171.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/187763171.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/187763171", "http://raiith.iith.ac.in/4751/1/Thesis_Phd_CE_4751.pdf", "http://raiith.iith.ac.in/4751/"]}, {"authors": ["Nguyen, Thanh-Binh", "Le, Minh-Tuan", "Ngo, Vu-Duc", "Nguyen, Tien-Dong", "Han, Huy-Dung"], "title": "Efficient Detectors based on Group Detection for Massive MIMO systems", "description": "In Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems, the complexities of detectors depend on the size of the channel matrix.

After that, we apply the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) and Bell Laboratory Layer Space Time (BLAST) detectors to each subsystem, resulting in the so-called MMSE-GD and BLAST-GD detectors, respectively. To further enhance the BER performance of Massive MIMO systems under the high-load conditions, we propose two additional detectors, called MMSE-IGD and BLAST-IGD by respectively applying the conventional MMSE and BLAST on the sub-systems in an iterative manner. It is shown via computer simulation and analytical results that the proposed detectors enable the system to achieve not only higher BER performance but also low detection complexities as compared to the conventional linear detectors.

It focuses on contraction between the National Coal Board\u2019s (NCB) vesting in 1947 and the closure of Lanarkshire\u2019s last colliery, Cardowan, in 1983. Deindustrialisation was not the natural outcome of either market forces or geological exhaustion. Colliery closures and falling coal employment were the result of policy-makers\u2019 decisions. The thesis consists of four thematic chapters: political economy, moral economy, class and community, and generation and gender. The analysis is based on archival sources including Scottish Office reports and correspondence relating to regional policy, and NCB records. These are supported by National Union of Mineworkers Scottish Area and STUC meeting minutes, and oral history testimonies from over 30 men and women with Lanarkshire coalfield backgrounds, as well as two focus groups.\n\n\n\nThe first two chapters analyse the process of deindustrialisation, with the first offering a top-down perspective and the second a bottom-up viewpoint. In chapter one deindustrialisation is analysed through changes in political economy. Shifts in labour market structure are examined through the development of regional policy and its administration by the Scottish Office. The analysis centres upon a policy network of Scottish business elites and civil servants who shaped a vision of modernisation via industrial diversification through attracting inward investment. In chapter two the perspective shifts to community and workforce. It analyses responses to coalfield contraction through a moral economy of customary rights to colliery employment. A detailed investigation of Lanarkshire colliery closures between the 1940s and 1980s emphasises the protracted nature of deindustrialisation. \n\n\n\nChapters three and four consider the social and cultural structures which shaped the moral economy but were heavily altered by deindustrialisation. Chapter three focuses on the dense networks that linked occupation, community, and class consciousness. Increasing coalfield centralisation and remote control of pits from NCB headquarters in London, and mounting hostility to coal closures, contributed to an accentuated sense of Scottish-ness. Chapter four illuminates gender and generational dimensions. The differing experiences of cohorts of men who faced either early retirement, redundancy or transfer to alternative sectors, or those who never attained anticipated industrial employment due to final closures, are analysed in terms of constructions of masculinity and the endurance of cultural as well as material losses. This is counterpoised to women who gained industrial work in assembly plants and the perceived gradual attainment of an improved economic and social position whilst continuing to navigate structures of patriarchy", "datePublished": "2016-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/211236959.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/211236959.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/211236959", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7751/", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7751/1/2016GibbsPhD.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Mikheil Giorgobiani", "Davit Chikovani"], "title": "Building Design Process using CAD and Graphic Programs", "description": "AutoCAD, with more than 3 Million licenses purchased worldwide, is the most widely used CAD software.

While some studies report completing a four-year engineering program has a positive influence on creativity and problem-solving skills, others highlight that creativity skills may actually decrease over this time. Several studies report that creativity is given insufficient space within engineering curriculum, highlighting a contributing factor to this issue. Creativity is a complex process involving numerous phases. The scope of this thesis is focused on the development of idea generation skills, and overcoming the issue of fixation. This thesis will primarily focus on the development of creativity skills through training in the use of creativity heuristics. Due to scope limitations, the practicality or viability of ideas will not be evaluated.   The purpose of this study was to: -Quantify the coverage of creativity material within engineering curricula in Australia and New Zealand. -Establish whether creativity training learning activities traditionally completed using pen-and-paper in a classroom environment can be successfully migrated to an online environment, without the influence of negative mode-effects on student learning outcomes. -Establish whether online creativity training activities are a viable way for teaching engineering students creativity and problem-solving skills.  The following research objectives were investigated: -Establish the extent that creativity-related topics are explicitly taught within engineering curricula in Australia and New Zealand, specifically including creativity heuristics training. -Establish whether there is a mode-effect in the context of creativity heuristics training, based upon ideation performance and self-efficacy. -Establish whether there is any measurable long-term benefit for students to spend time engaged in tasks that expose them to the use of creativity heuristics, and whether there is a long-term mode-effect on ideation performance. -Establish from an educator`s point of view whether creativity heuristics training is viable, and when and how it should be introduced to engineering curricula. -Establish whether students prefer to complete creativity heuristics training using one mode or the other (computer or pen-and-paper). This study utilised a mixed methods approach using both quantitative and qualitative methods in different stages of the study: -The first phase was a mixed methods research design. 1109 publicly accessible course outlines from forty-nine Australian and New Zealand electrical engineering programs hosted by thirty-two different institutions, were analysed to collect data and carry out evaluations.  The second phase included three quasi-experiments, using a primarily quantitative research design. The first experiment involved seventy first year students, one hundred and fifty-three third year students and thirty-eight postgraduate students. The second experiment involved ninety third year students. The third experiment involved forty-eight first year students. The key findings of the study are: -Quantification of the coverage of creativity-related material in engineering curricula on a national level as opposed to being limited to one or two tertiary institutions. -There is no observable mode-effect in the context of creativity training where students learn to apply creativity heuristics, based upon either ideation performance or self-efficacy. -Engaging engineering students in a standalone idea generation activity of less than an hour duration has measurable performance benefits, and there was no observable difference in longitudinal ideation performance based on mode used in the creativity training. -Students show positive interest towards standalone learning activities designed to enhance their creativity and idea generation skills. As an overall cohort, students show slight preference for completing such activities using computer over pen-and-paper. -First year students may be more willing or able to make use of creativity heuristics training. Students in higher year levels may be more resistant to learning such topics.  The key findings have implications for practice. When designing engineering curricula, the following factors should be taken into account regarding the development of creativity and problem-solving skills: -Engineers Australia and Engineering New Zealand may adapt their criteria for assessing whether engineering programs foster creativity skills or not. Engineering programs should require students to explicitly learn about creative theory and creativity techniques, as opposed to implicitly only through the completion of engineering design projects. -It is recommended courses focused on developing creativity and problem-solving skills are introduced to first year of study. Additionally, creativity material should be increased throughout the engineering program. -Developing online creativity training activities and making them widely available may be one way which the creativity and problem-solving skills of engineering students may be effectively enhanced throughout an engineering degree. Especially where an institution otherwise has a lack of creativity-related material throughout their engineering curricula. -Making creativity training available in students` first year of study is ideal as students may be more willing to engage with the activity, and it provides more time throughout their degree when they can practice and make use of the training.  The research findings of the study contribute to the existing literature in the following ways: -Much more comprehensive understanding of the extent of coverage of creativity-related material within Australian and New Zealand engineering education. -Better understanding of the influence that creativity heuristics training is has on students` longitudinal idea generation performance. -Substantial addition to the available literature in regards to mode-effect in the context of creativity training activities, both in terms of initial and longitudinal effects. -Contribution to the understanding of mode-preference within different contexts. Within creativity heuristics training, students show preference for using computers. -Identification that students show positive attitudes specifically towards creativity heuristics training activities, as opposed to creativity in general or courses focused on creativity.  Results of this study provide useful information for educators relevant to teaching creativity and problem-solving skills within engineering education. Findings in this thesis can lead to the increased adoption of creativity material within engineering curricula, and the development of online applications which can engage engineering students in building their creativity and problem-solving skills. Future work may conduct longitudinal research to establish whether engaging students in creativity heuristics training regularly throughout their program of study, can lead to observable benefits to their creativity skills upon graduation. Future research may expand the types of creativity training considered, and broaden the focus to include aspects of creativity training other than heuristics", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "RMIT University", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/186353826.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/186353826.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/186353826", "https://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:162603"]}, {"authors": ["Rohmatillah, Mahdin", "Pramono, Sholeh Hadi", "Asyari, Rifa Atul Izza Asyari"], "title": "Implementation of Deep Learning Based Method for Optimizing Spatial Diversity MIMO Communication", "description": "As an alternative solution of the isuue trade-off phenomenon between performance and computational complexity always become the hugest dilemma suffered by researchers, this research proposes an optimization in spatial diversity MIMO communication system using end-to-end learning based model, specifically, it adapts autoencoder model.

Radionuclides can move through water, so monitoring is essential. A monitoring system has been established to detect beta-nuclides in water samples around nuclear facilities. Beta-nuclides, including tritium, have a short range and difficulty in detecting in water samples. In order to solve this problem, the detection chamber of the structure in which the scintillator and the water sample directly contact is designed and constructed. The system is constructed using a plastic scintillator that does not react with water and has a low background level because of its low atomic number.\n\nIn order to increase detection efficiency, the area of reaction between the water sample and the scintillator is increased by using the multi-layer scintillators structure. Thirteen scintillators are used for low energy beta, such as 3H, and seven scintillators were used for the relatively high energy 90Sr.\n\nUsing the manufactured detection chamber, an electronics of monitoring system for each nuclide is set. The change of the detection efficiency is confirmed by changing the amplification degree of the main amplifier. The amplification degree of the main amplifier is selected for each case of 3H and 90Sr.\n\nThe major beta nuclides, 90Sr and 3H nuclides are considered, and the performance of the system is evaluated by the time required to derive the MDA to satisfy regulatory standards for each nuclide. The liquid radioactive effluent level is used for 90Sr and 3H. In case of 90Sr, it takes 18 seconds to satisfy 0.02 Bq/g of effluent level. In the case of 3H, it takes 2,300 seconds to satisfy the standard for effluent level of 40 Bq/g.\n\nIt is considered that scintillation-based radiation monitoring systems for beta nuclide in water can be used to evaluate effluent level for 3H and 90Sr. The system is expected to be used to ensure the radiological safety of the operating nuclear facilities and decommissioning sites of nuclear power plants.clos", "datePublished": "2020-02-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Graduate School of UNIST", "subjects": ["Doctoral thesis"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/304590713.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/304590713.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/304590713", "https://scholarworks.unist.ac.kr/handle/201301/31801", "http://unist.dcollection.net/common/orgView/200000287922"]}, {"authors": ["Jernberg, Adam"], "title": "Dissemination of information through various channels and media within an organization", "description": "I dag s\u00e5 sprids information p\u00e5 ett helt annat sa\u0308tt a\u0308n vad den gjorde fo\u0308r b\u00e5de fem och tjugo \u00e5r sedan och i takt med att tekniken utvecklas s\u00e5 fo\u0308ra\u0308ndras v\u00e5rt sa\u0308tt att ta del av information.

Because of the challenge of General Academic Education (GAE) that its products face unemployment, the other perspective of education, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), has gained momentum for it has the potential to contribute significantly in development. This study establishes therefore the extent to which tertiary TVET career awareness and curricula quality and control are effective in the contexts of the Republic of South Africa (RSA) and Lesotho. \r\n\r\nRSA and Lesotho are neighbours with a unique feature where RSA completely surrounds Lesotho. They have similar structures of governance under one type of government, democracy. They also have reciprocal relationship where Lesotho exports water to RSA for royalties and RSA earns money through granting Basotho chance to further studies and by admitting patients for quaternary health services. Modern education background in both countries was introduced by Whites and with time was controlled by their governments after independence to better their nations. \r\n\r\nThe study has been premised on theoretical and conceptual frameworks. Theoretical framework has emphasized that promotion of skills is important for production and innovation leading to economy based generally on knowledge. The conceptual framework covers understanding of main concepts in the study. It has clearly shown how they apply in the context of the study. \r\n\r\nLiterature investigation has covered two issues. In the first, it explored framework of TVET with background of TVET in the global context. It also revealed justification of TVET with regard to societal development looking mostly in the economic aspect. Understanding TVET with education cycles has thereafter been shown to highlight TVET trend within the hierarchy. It further explored TVET models in Europe, followed by management of TVET as well as general curricula. Then, in the general context the researcher, through literature, discussed ways in which TVET institutions can conduct career awareness, curricula aspects and ways by which graduates can be assisted without any empirical investigation. Also, TVET has been explored in African context looking first in the African Union (AU) perspective and second Southern African Development Community (SADC) to show policy framework. In the second, it revealed empirical literature in the context of Africa on the issues of career awareness conduct by TVET institutions, their quality assurance and control of curricula and their initiatives taken to assist graduates engage in self-employment. \r\n\r\nThe research design involves a mixed method research which combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches. It has specifically adopted QUANTITATIVE-qualitative research, that is, quantitative part dominates the whole exercise of data collection while qualitative part validates findings of the former. The survey was administered through questionnaires and interviews at Lerotholi Polytechnic and Motheo TVET College. Its population is comprised of lecturers, students and marketing officers. It has had a total sample of 102 respondents: Lerotholi Polytechnic comprised 33 students, 13 lecturers and 1marketing officer while Motheo TVET College 38 students, 16 lecturers and 1 marketing officer. Both questionnaires and interviews were guided by purposive sampling technique to lecturers and completing students in electrical and water engineering. \r\n\r\nOn the basis of methodology, the study has found that the Lerotholi Polytechnic and Motheo TVET College conduct career awareness, but it focuses on prospective secondary schools\u2019 students, not their completing students. The study has also found that the two institutions offer education and training in curricula that are responsive to the national development goals. They accept new members on condition that they meet standardized requirements and have planned with Central University of Technology and National University of Lesotho to engage their personnel for professional development. It is only in the case of Motheo TVET College where curriculum transformation occurs while at Lerotholi Polytechnic is unmemorable. The study has further found a concern of inadequacy in infrastructure, equipment, instructional technology and they compromise quality of education. While Lerotholi Polytechnic offers enterprise and entrepreneurial education in water and environmental engineering, Motheo TVET College does not in all engineering programmes and this denies students opportunity to begin their own businesses. After graduation, the institutions do not engage in assisting their graduates to commence economic activities for livelihoods purposes. \r\n\r\nImproving the institutions, it is recommended that first Lerotholi Polytechnic establishes a clearly articulated framework by departments and approved by institutional management on transformation of curriculum while Motheo TVET College integrates entrepreneurial education to promote self-employment by graduates. Secondly, the institutions, under the auspices of governments and private sector, should improve infrastructural developments and at the same time recruit more lecturers. Also, equipment and instructional technology should be improved for quality education and training. Thirdly and lastly, Lerotholi Polytechnic and Motheo TVET College should formulate policy by which they strategize ways of adopting business incubation and acceleration for graduates", "datePublished": "2018-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Bloemfontein : Central University of Technology, Free State", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/222968112.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/222968112.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/222968112", "http://hdl.handle.net/11462/1967"]}, {"authors": ["Jin, Yu-Fang"], "title": "Training Students for Critical Thinking in an Electrical Engineering Core Course", "description": "Analysis and Design of Control Systems is a core course in most Electrical Engineering programs in the United States.

Our goal is to estimate the probability density function (PDF) of the states and parameters given noisy observations of the output of the hidden Markov model. We consider three problems, namely, (i) determining the PDF of the states in a non-linear HMM using sequential MCMC techniques, (ii) determining the parameters of discretized linear, ordinary differential equations (ODE) given noisy observations of the solutions and\n(iii) Determining the PDF of the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation when the parameters of the ODE are random variables. While these problems naturally arise in several areas in engineering, this thesis is motivated by potential applications in bio-mechanics. One of the interesting research questions that is being considered by some researchers is whether the formation of clots can be predicted by observing the mechanical properties of arteries, such as their stiff ness. In order for this approach to be successful, it is critical to estimate the stiffness of arteries based on noisy measurements of their mechanical response. The parameters of these models can then be used to differentiate diseased arteries from healthy ones or, the parameters can be used to predict the probability of formation of plaques. From experimental data, we would like to infer the posterior density of the states and parameters (such as stiffness), and classify it as being healthy or diseased. If it is accomplished, this will improve the state-of-the art in modeling mechanical properties of arteries, which could lead to better prediction, and diagnosis of coronary artery disease", "datePublished": "2016-09-05T14:31:48", "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/147248935.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/147248935.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/147248935", "http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/157612"]}, {"authors": ["Simmons, Nidhi", "Nogueira Da Silva, Carlos Rafael", "Cotton, Simon", "Sofotasios, Paschalis", "Yoo, Seong Ki", "Yacoub, Michel"], "title": "On Shadowing the \u03ba-\u03bc Fading Model", "datePublished": "2020-07-29T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/access.2020.3005527", "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "subjects": ["article"], "year": 2020, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/327079270.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/327079270.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/327079270", "https://pure.coventry.ac.uk/ws/files/30392055/Binder7.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2020.3005527", "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/on-shadowing-the--fading-model(47ec5f1b-eeda-40c9-a6ed-786ce64db216).html", "http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=85088305180&partnerID=8YFLogxK"]}, {"authors": ["Dantas, Rui", "Liang, Jun", "Ugalde Loo, Carlos Ernesto", "Adamczyk, Andrzej", "Barker, Carl", "Whitehouse, Robert"], "title": "Progressive fault isolation and grid restoration strategy for MTDC networks", "description": "A multi-terminal dc (MTDC) grid has a number of advantages over traditional ac transmission. However, dc protection is still one of the main technical issues holding back the expansion of point-to-point dc links to MTDC networks. Most dc protection strategies are based on dc circuit breakers (DCCBs); however, DCCBs are still under development and their arrival to the market will come at an unclear time and cost. Conversely, ac circuit breakers (ACCBs) are readily available and represent a more economic alternative to protect dc networks. Following this line, a protection strategy for MTDC grids is proposed in this paper. This uses ACCBs for dc fault current clearing and fast dc disconnectors for fault isolation. The faulty link is correctly discriminated and isolated while communication links are not required. This strategy contributes to a reduced network outage period as the non-faulty links are out of operation for a relatively short period of time and are restored in a progressive manner.

Previous studies on drop-out shows that students that have dropped out are more likely to be unemployed and living in poverty compared to those students that have successfully completed their programmes. In 2006 the Minister of Labour declared that FET Colleges in South Africa have a major role to play in assisting youth in gaining skills and thereby halving poverty and the unemployment rate by the year 2014. This declaration highlights the importance of FET colleges and amplifies the need for a strategy to maximise students\u2019 retention and minimise drop-out rate. This study utilise a random sampling method to select respondents. Data were collected using a questionnaire with a quantitative approach and designed in a Likert scale format. The study was limited to students at West Coast FET College\u2019s campuses namely: Atlantis, Vredenburg, Malmesbury and Citrusdal. One hundred and fifty students were used as respondents and data were gathered from the questionnaires. The findings derived from the data revealed that multiple factors are perceived to be the cause of high student dropout. These factors are lack of finances for transport and accommodation especially for the first years and social context of individual learners. The study concludes that although finance and social context of individual learner are perceived drop-out factors, other personal attributes like learners\u2019 attitude to learning and commitment also plays a role in students drop-out and drop-out intention", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "Cape Peninsula University of Technology", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/196145418.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/196145418.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/196145418", "http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11838/2821", "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0"]}, {"authors": ["Howard, Heather A", "Zwicky, Dave", "Phillips, Margaret"], "title": "Academic libraries support cross-disciplinary innovation and entrepreneurship", "description": "Supporting innovation is essential in today\u2019s academic ecosystem, and libraries are well-positioned to connect prospective entrepreneurs with the myriad resources and services available.

In a bid to and provide practical measures through which the menace of building collapse can be curbed, this study examines the causes of building collapse in Nigeria. The methodology includes; conduction of investigations and site inspections and secondary data. The study reveals that building collapse in Nigeria emanates majorly from; overloading, lack of maintenance, illegal Alteration or conversion of existing buildings, quackery, use of inadequate/improper foundation, inadequate preliminary site investigation, poor concrete mix ratio, inadequate structural analysis / design, lack of adherence to material specification / poor building material specification, inadequate supervision by professionals.

A centralized hierarchical control system is proposed to coordinate the operation between multiple CFCs. A novel voltage sharing control scheme is demonstrated. It is shown that such scheme reduces the workload on a single CFC by sharing the required control voltage between multiple CFCs, and, additionally, can be used to avoid control conflicts among active CFCs during communication failure. An experimental platform consisting on a 3-terminal dc grid and small scale 2B-CFC prototypes has been developed to validate the concepts.

Nevertheless, balancing production and consumption is and will always be a crucial requirement for power system operation. However, the trend towards increasing RESs penetration has raised concerns about the stability, reliability and security of future electricity grids. The clearest observation in this regard is the intermittent nature of RESs.  Moreover, the location of renewable generation tends to be heavily defined by meteorological and geographical conditions, which makes the generation sites distant from load centres. These facts make the analysis of electricity grid operation under both dynamic and the steady state more difficult, posing challenges in effectively integrating variable RESs into electricity networks. The thesis reports on studies that were conducted to design efficient tools and algorithms for system operators, especially transmission system operators for reliable short-term system operation that accounts for intermittency and security requirements. Initially, the impact of renewable generation on the steady state is studied in the operation stage. Then, based on the first study, more sophisticated modeling on the electricity network are investigated in the third and fourth chapters. Extending the previous studies, the fourth chapter explores the potential of using multiple microgrids to support the main grid\u2019s security control. Finally, the questions regarding the computational efficiency and convergence analysis are addressed in chapter 5 and a DSM model in a real-time pricing environment is introduced.

The thesis consists of four thematic chapters: political economy, moral economy, class and community, and generation and gender. The analysis is based on archival sources including Scottish Office reports and correspondence relating to regional policy, and NCB records. These are supported by National Union of Mineworkers Scottish Area and STUC meeting minutes, and oral history testimonies from over 30 men and women with Lanarkshire coalfield backgrounds, as well as two focus groups.\n\n\n\nThe first two chapters analyse the process of deindustrialisation, with the first offering a top-down perspective and the second a bottom-up viewpoint. In chapter one deindustrialisation is analysed through changes in political economy. Shifts in labour market structure are examined through the development of regional policy and its administration by the Scottish Office. The analysis centres upon a policy network of Scottish business elites and civil servants who shaped a vision of modernisation via industrial diversification through attracting inward investment. In chapter two the perspective shifts to community and workforce. It analyses responses to coalfield contraction through a moral economy of customary rights to colliery employment. A detailed investigation of Lanarkshire colliery closures between the 1940s and 1980s emphasises the protracted nature of deindustrialisation. \n\n\n\nChapters three and four consider the social and cultural structures which shaped the moral economy but were heavily altered by deindustrialisation. Chapter three focuses on the dense networks that linked occupation, community, and class consciousness. Increasing coalfield centralisation and remote control of pits from NCB headquarters in London, and mounting hostility to coal closures, contributed to an accentuated sense of Scottish-ness. Chapter four illuminates gender and generational dimensions. The differing experiences of cohorts of men who faced either early retirement, redundancy or transfer to alternative sectors, or those who never attained anticipated industrial employment due to final closures, are analysed in terms of constructions of masculinity and the endurance of cultural as well as material losses. This is counterpoised to women who gained industrial work in assembly plants and the perceived gradual attainment of an improved economic and social position whilst continuing to navigate structures of patriarchy", "datePublished": "2016-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/293051207.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/293051207.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/293051207", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7751/1/2016GibbsPhD.pdf", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7751/"]}, {"authors": ["Batten College of Engineering & Technology"], "title": "Illuminator, Volume 1, Issue 4", "description": "January 2018 issue of Illuminator, a monthly publication of ODU\\u27s Batten College of Engineering and Technology.https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/engineering_newsletter/1014/thumbnail.jp", "datePublished": "2018-01-01T08:00:00", "publisher": "ODU Digital Commons", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/226775861.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/226775861.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/226775861", "https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/engineering_newsletter/18", "https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=engineering_newsletter"]}, {"authors": ["Tokel, Halil Alper", "Al Halaseh, Rana", "Alirezaei, Gholamreza", "Mathar, Rudolf"], "title": "A Co-Simulation Framework for Integrated Planning and Analysis of Wide Area Measurement and Protection Systems", "description": "The recent efforts to extend measurement and communication infrastructures in power grids have brought about new potentials for a more efficient and optimized grid operation using the data which become available.

A major hindrance to the increased use of Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) in cast-in-place applications in the South African construction industry is the lack of information about and understanding of, lateral formwork pressure exerted by SCC.\r\nThere are no accepted standardised codes or guidelines for the local construction industry that can be used to facilitate the design of formwork for predicting formwork pressure exerted by SCC. Formwork systems designers have been encouraged to design formwork to withstand full hydrostatic pressures, unless a method based on appropriate and reliable experimental data is available. This generally limits contractors to low wall or extremely strong formwork, which can lead to extra formwork costs. Numerous parameters, including placement conditions, material properties and formwork characteristics can influence lateral formwork pressure.\r\nThis study presents the results of an experimental investigation undertaken using on-site conditions, aimed at studying the influence of placement methods (top-down and bottom-up pumping), of various casting rates, as well as implementing predetermined waiting periods of 10 and 15 minutes between castings. The influence of each of these parameters was evaluated by using six vertical instrumented wall elements. All six walls were fitted with eight flush diaphragms transducers and were identical in dimensions (5.4 m x 2.0 m x 0.25 m).\r\nThe test results show that with high casting rates from the top of the formwork system, hydrostatic pressure can be expected. It was shown that by interrupting the casting procedure and implementing waiting periods to allow the fresh SCC to set, decreased the lateral pressure exerted. It was found that, when pumping from the base of the formwork system at high casting rates, hydrostatic pressure could be expected during the casting process and that lateral pressures above the hydrostatic pressure could be expected during the casting of the SCC. The knowledge gained in this study can therefore be used to lay the foundation for future studies for the prediction of lateral pressure exerted on formwork by SCC under South African conditions.AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Een van die uitdagings vir die Suid Afrikaanse konstruksie industrie is tans in die gebied van die laterale druk wat op bekisting uitgeoefen word deur selfkompaktende beton (SCC), en spesifiek die akkurate voorspelling van hierdie druk. \u2018n Groot hindernis tot die meer algemene gebruik van SCC in die giet van beton in die Suid Afrikaanse konstruksie industrie is die gebrek aan inligting oor, en die begrip van, die laterale druk wat op bekisting uitgeoefen word deur SCC.\r\nDaar bestaan geen aanvaarde standaard kodes of riglyne vir die plaaslike konstruksie industrie om die ontwerp van bekisting te vergemaklik deur die laterale druk van SCC op bekisting te voorspel nie. Bekisting stelselontwerpers word aangemoedig om bekisting te ontwerp om die volle hidrostatiese druk te kan weerstaan, tensy \u2018n ander metode beskikbaar is wat op toepaslik en betroubare data gebasseer is. Dit beperk kontrakteurs gewoonlik tot of lae muur of uiters sterk bekisting, wat tot ho\u00eb bekistingskoste kan lei. Verskeie parameters, insluitend plasingstoestande, material eienskappe en bekistingseienskappe, kan die laterale druk van SCC op bekisting be\u00efnvloed.\r\nHierdie studie verskaf resultate van \u2018n eksperimentele ondersoek wat onder terrein toestande onderneem is, met die doel om die invloed van plasingsmethodes te bepaal (van bo na onder gepomp, sowel as van onder na bo), van verskillende giet-tempos, sowel as voorafbepaalde wagperiodes met duurtes van 10 en 15 minute tussen gietperiodes. Die invloed van elk van die parameters is evalueer deur die gebruik van ses vertikale muurelemente met gemonteerde drukmeters. Op elke muurelement is agt diafragma sensors gemonteer. Die afmetings van al die mure was dieselfde (5.4 m x 2.0 m x 0.25 m).\r\nDie toetsresultate toon dat \u2018n ho\u00eb giet-tempo vanaf die bokant van die bekistingstelsel, \u2018n hidrostatiese druk tot gevolg het. Dit is bewys dat onderbreking van hierdie gietproses met wagperiodes, wat toelaat dat die vars SCC kan set, die laterale druk op die bekisting verminder. Dit is gevind dat, wanneer SCC vanaf die onderkant van die bekisting gepomp word teen \u2018n ho\u00eb tempo, hidrostatiese druk verwag kan word teen die einde van die gietproses en dat laterale druk op die bekisting bo hidrostatiese druk sal styg tydens die gietproses. Die kennis verwerf tydens hierdie studie kan dus van nut wees as die basis vir toekomstige studies wat kan lei tot die akkurate voorspelling van die laterale druk van SCC op die bekisting onder verskillende omstandighede in Suid Afrika", "datePublished": "2018-03-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Stellenbosch : Stellenbosch University", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/188220317.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/188220317.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/188220317", "http://hdl.handle.net/10019.1/103400"]}, {"authors": ["Alsaif, M"], "title": "Electronic and optical properties of two dimensional Molybdenum Oxide Nanoflakes", "description": "In this research, the PhD candidate became involved in the development of gas sensors, plasmonic systems and field effect transistors (FETs) based on a solvent-assisted grinding and sonication liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) method of two-dimensional (2D) molybdenum oxide nanoflakes. The electronic band structure of this material is highly tunable, making it apposite for a variety of electronic and optical applications. The layered structure &amp;alpha; phase of this crystal (&amp;alpha;-MoO3) and high surface to volume of 2D &amp;alpha;-MoO3 can accommodate a high capacity of intercalated charges and enable adsorption of atoms and molecules at remarkable efficiencies.  The candidate continued her PhD research by developing conductometric gas sensor films made of 2D MoO3 nanoflakes based on the grinding-assisted LPE technique, and used these sensors for hydrogen (H2) gas detection. The study confirmed that the layered MoO3 nanostructure with high surface-to-volume ratio facilitated the H2 gas interaction and the outcomes were better in comparison to many previous reports for H2 sensing based on other nanostructure morphologies of MoO3.  In the next stage of this project, the PhD candidate demonstrated the emergence of highly controllable plasmon resonances in 2D molybdenum oxide flakes. The PhD candidate demonstrated that due to the effect of a large depolarization factor in 2D molybdenum oxide, the plasmon resonance peaks could be tuned within the visible range region, which could not be shown for any other 2D materials. Moreover, the biosensing capability of plasmonic 2D molybdenum oxide nanoflakes using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a model protein was demonstrated.  In the third stage of this research, in order to show the effect of liquid exfoliation of the 2D flakes and the light illumination parameters, the candidate synthesized 2D molybdenum oxide nanoflakes via the LPE method in five mixtures of water with different solvent types. It was revealed that plasmonic peaks strongly depended on the free electron concentration, and the extinction coefficients of the plasmonic absorption bands of 2D molybdenum oxide nanoflakes in all samples were found to be very high in the order of 109 L.mol-1.cm-1. Moreover, plasmonic biosensing experiments were conducted to reveal the efficient tuning of 2D plasmonic flakes in sensing biological components.  By using these outcomes drawn from the previous measurements and characterizations, plasmonic 2D flakes were also tested for plasmonic gas sensing. Highly sensitive optical H2 gas sensors based on quasi-metallic Mo4O11 films with plasmonic responses were developed. This study was the first demonstration of using plasmonic properties of 2D materials for gas sensing.  In the final stage of this PhD project, the candidate fabricated high-performance FETs made from thin film channels, based on the drop-casting of electronic inks. By investigating the performance of these FETs as a function of sub-stoichiometric levels that were obtained under different solar irradiation durations, the candidate found that the electron mobility value for the FET was significantly higher than the mobility of most of the previously reported thin film based transistors made from other 2D materials. In addition, this research revealed that by controlling and manipulating the oxygen deficiencies in 2D flakes, the carrier concentrations, electronic energy band edges, and carrier charge mobilities can be tuned", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "RMIT University", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2016, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/32240496.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/32240496.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/32240496", "https://researchbank.rmit.edu.au/view/rmit:161580"]}, {"authors": ["Mitchell, K"], "title": "Better for the students and easier for us: factors shaping vocational educators&#039; perceptions of e-Learning", "description": "Much of the discussion and policy about the vocational education (VET) sector, recently and over the last decade, have prioritised the need for flexible delivery, competition and innovation, with e-Learning typically framed as a key strategy to support this directive.

However, ENR has high molecular weight which limits its solubility and its processability. This study concerns the degradation of ENR to shorter chain lengths to form liquid epoxidized natural rubber (LENR) employing 5 different methods, i.e. (i) mechanical milling, (ii) chemical degradation initiated by potassium peroxodisulfate, (iii) photo-oxidation initiated by ultra violet (UV), (iv) oxidative degradation by periodic acid (H5IO6) and (v) oxidative degradation by potassium permanganate (KMnO4). The first three methods [(i), (ii) and (iii)] break-down of ENR is via free radicals, but at different rates and mechanisms. FTIR and NMR results showed that in these three methods ketone, aldehyde, carboxylic acid, ester and lactone groups were observed; however only during the UV degradation a hydrofuranic structure was formed. The oxirane group was not affected significantly during the degradation, indicating that the chain scissions had occurred predominantly via the double bonds. Comparison of the NMR and FTIR spectra of degradation products showed that UV degradation induced more carbonyl and hydroxyl groups to the backbone of the ENR. Increasing of oxygen concentration did not enhance the efficiency in UV degradation method. Mastication with two roll mill produced LENR with greatest degree of unsaturation and less amounts of polar groups. The last two methods [(iv) and (v)] degraded ENR through chemical oxidative degradation. The products of these two methods were compared with LENR obtained from degradation initiated by UV irradiation. Degradation of ENR by KMnO4 and UV irradiation proceeded mostly by attack via double bond, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy irradiation proceeded mostly by attack via double bond, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy whereby a decrease in the ratio peak areas of epoxy methine proton to olefinic methine proton was observed. At concentration of above 0.044 mol H5IO6 per hundred grams of rubber (mphr), degradation occurred by ring opening of the oxirane group as confirmed by the NMR of the LENR which showed an increase in the ratio peak areas of olefinic methine proton to epoxy methine proton. The LENR obtained by H5IO6 has more ketone groups while the LENR from degradation by KMnO4 has more ester groups. Cyclization of isoprene unit was only observed during the degradation by H5IO6. Among these methods, H5IO6 has achieved the fastest rate of degradation and lowest Mn under comparable conditions. For coating application, methyl methacrylate (MMA) was graft copolymerized onto LENR using UV radiation and benzophenone as photo initiator. The best grafting efficiency was observed by 0.84 parts per hundred resin (phr) of benzophenone. DSC thermograms showed a small positive shift in Tg of LENR compared to ENR 25. LENR-graft-PMMA showed a great increase in Tg (42\u00baC), because incorporation of hard segments of PMMA onto LENR. The obtained PMMA-graft-LENR was cured with three different amines and evaluated as coatings materials. Overall, the best results for coating performances were observed by curing of PMMA-graft-LENR with a cycloaliphatic amine. This type of coating demonstrated the best hardness, adhesion, water and salt resistances", "datePublished": "2017-08-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/268879350.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268879350.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/268879350", "http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/8147/1/All.pdf", "http://studentsrepo.um.edu.my/8147/6/pejvak.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Wang, Fang", "Wang, Jianmei", "Wang, Kun", "Hua, Changchun", "Zong, Qun"], "title": "Finite-time control for uncertain systems and application to flight control", "description": "In this paper, the finite-time control design problem for a class of nonlinear systems with matched and mismatched uncertainty is addressed.

To understand the ESD noise phenomena and improve the system-level ESD noise immunity for devices, the accurate ESD noise measurement and analysis of IC logic errors are necessary.\n\nSection I is written for the tendency of ESD research and previous research. This paper presents the noise type correlation by measuring the signal-ground noise and power-ground noise simultaneously on the fundamental F/F operation circuit and shows the type of error from chip, in section II. Furthermore, the decoupling capacitors (de-cap) effect that can reduce the error occurrence by checking the error rate are analyzed. A generator is designed on the main board which is based on real operating laptop, and the chip on dual in-line memory module (DIMM) is also designed to perform the basic F/F operation. The clock and data input from generator are connected to the chip on the DIMM through the small outline dual in-line memory module (SODIMM) socket. ESD occurs at the corner of the ground plane of main board. The specification of the ESD generator satisfies IEC 61000-4-2 [1]. The ESD current flows along the ground strap, and affects the DIMM. IN-ground, CLK-ground, OUT-ground and power-ground on the DIMM are simultaneously measured to determine the effect of ESD on the main board. To analyze the error ratio according to the ESD voltage level, the voltage setup of the ESD gun is 3kV, 5kV and 8kV. To investigate the effects of chip shielding and DIMM de-caps on the error probability of DIMM, the experiment is conducted under the several conditions. After confirming the normal operation for each condition, the error type on the DIMM due to the ESD occurred in the circuit is analyzed and the statistics are shown. The results are verified by H-spice simulation, Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) and HFSS simulation. In order to obtain the improvement method of the DIMM immunity, experiments are conducted to find out the effective position and number of DIMM de-cap. \n\nAccurate measurements of electromagnetic fields are also essential to analyze the radiated noise due to unwanted electrostatic discharge (ESD) events at electronic devices. Usually, to know the radiated noise by ESD events, the voltages induced at field probes are measured, and the fields are obtained from the voltage by de-convolving the probe factor. In section ???, the two probe-factor deconvolution methods are investigated and compared in the measurements of the fields induced by system-level ESD events.ope", "datePublished": "2017-08-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Graduate School of UNIST", "subjects": ["Master's thesis"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/92422135.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/92422135.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/92422135", "http://unist.dcollection.net/jsp/common/DcLoOrgPer.jsp?sItemId=000002380832", "https://scholarworks.unist.ac.kr/handle/201301/22499"]}, {"authors": ["Wang, Xinyi", "Liu, Yilu", "Tong, Lang"], "title": "Adaptive Subband Compression of Streaming Data for Power System\n  Monitoring and Control", "description": "A data compression system capable of providing high-fidelity high-resolution\nstreaming of power system real-time measurements is proposed.

In the past decades, a huge number of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) plants have been constructed all around the world. However, the capital and operational costs can be high, which limits their widespread applications. Because the installed PV modules often operate in harsh environments (i.e. storm, high temperature, dust, hail, etc.), non-uniform aging phenomena of PV modules cannot be avoided and it impacts adversely on the performance of PV plants, especially in the middle and late periods of their service life. This paper develops an offline PV module reconfiguration strategy for the non-uniform aging PV array to mitigate this effect.

The risk profile of radical NPD projects differed to that of incremental projects. SMEs were more vulnerable to NPD project risks than large firms. Most risks influenced NPD projects equally across industrial sectors. Members of NPD project teams from different backgrounds or with different roles perceived risks differently.\r\nThe proposed taxonomy and its subsequent empirical validation provides a comprehensive and robust taxonomy for identifying and managing risks associated with different types of NPD project conducted by firms of varying sizes from different industrial sectors", "datePublished": "2017-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Cranfield University", "subjects": ["Thesis or dissertation", "Doctoral", "PhD"], "year": 2017, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132205598.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/132205598", "http://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/12722"]}, {"authors": ["Ledenyov, Dmytro"], "title": "Modelling and experimental investigation of nonlinear properties of YBa\u2082Cu\u2083O\u2087 and NdBa\u2082Cu\u2083O\u2087 superconducting films and resonators for applications in microwave circuits", "description": "Nonlinear effects arising in High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) under elevated electromagnetic signal power levels can significantly limit HTS superior microwave characteristics. Understanding the extent of those limitations and possibly predicting them by modelling microwave properties of high temperature superconductors can yield a substantial advantage at early stages of microwave device design and manufacturing. Therefore, one of the main objectives of this thesis is to investigate if it is feasible to expand modelling of microwave properties of superconductors including nonlinear effects in more details. In addition, an experimental investigation was conducted in this thesis focusing on the question if there is any HTS material that exhibits smaller nonlinear effects than found in the widely utilised YBa\u2082Cu\u2083O\u2087 (YBCO) superconductor.\n\n\n\nA novel approach towards the development of an advanced lumped element model of HTS materials that can accurately represent nonlinear effects in a microwave resonator is presented in this thesis. The theoretical model engineered by the author, more comprehensively represents superconducting phenomena than the standard two-fluid model. Simulation results demonstrated close correspondence with the measured characteristics of HTS films under test. The developed model could be suitable for advanced CAD tools applicable for design of HTS electronic circuits, that need to take into account the complex nature of nonlinear effects.\n\n\n\nIn reference to the experimental investigation, microwave properties of YBa\u2082Cu\u2083O\u2087 thin films and improved NdBa\u2082Cu\u2083O\u2087 (NdBCO) thin films on MgO substrates were examined by the author. In addition, a comprehensive microwave investigation of YBCO and NdBCO microstrip resonators manufactured at Tsinghua University (China) utilising thin films, manufactured in the same laboratory (Ceraco) using the same thermal coevaporation technique, was also conducted. The measurements for the thin films and resonators were performed at frequencies of 25GHz and 2.1GHz respectively, as a function of temperature and varying RF input power (from -5dBm to +30dBm). A thorough analysis of the onset of nonlinear effects in YBCO and NdBCO thin films and resonators is presented and comparatively discussed. The performed investigations show that NdBCO thin films and NdBCO resonators demonstrated higher values of the onset of nonlinearities than YBCO thin films and YBCO resonators. Smaller nonlinear effects observed in NdBCO films and NdBCO microstrip resonators could give them an advantage over YBCO films and resonators for applications in microwave circuits", "datePublished": "2018-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.25903/5b6cc378be158", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2018, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/303788103.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/303788103.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/303788103", "https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/55990/1/JCU_55990-ledenyov-2018-thesis.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Xu, Juncai", "Shen, Zhenzhong", "Ren, Qingwen", "Xie, Xin", "Yang, Zhengyu"], "title": "Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming Algorithm and Slump Prediction", "description": "Research on the performance of recycled concrete as building material in the\ncurrent world is an important subject.

As the novelty, to enhance bandwidth and reduce antenna size, beleved half-cut microstrip structure is proposed. Further, this proposed antenna structure will be applied to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna 2\u00b42. Therefore, this research was investigated conventional circular shape antenna (CCSA), circular shaped beleved antenna (CSBA), and MIMO circular shaped beleved antenna (MIMO-CBSA) as Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3, respectively. An FR4 substrate with er= 4.4, thickness h=1.6 mm, and tan d=0.0265 was used. The simulation has been conducted using Advanced Design System (ADS). The antenna CCSA/CSBA/ MIMO-CBSA achieve 1.831GHz/2.265 GHz/2.256 GHz, -15.13dB/-17.37dB/-17.25 dB, 1.42/1.31/1.33, and 1.474/2.332/2.322 for center frequency, reflection coefficient, VSWR, and bandwidth, respectively. This antenna has a size 63x90 mm and 51.5x90 mm for CCSA (Model 1) and CSBA (Model 2), respectively.

In conjunction with this phenomenon, previous studies suggest that there is an increasing number of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) conducting international business (e.g. Oviatt and McDougall, 2005; and Ketkar and Acs, 2013). However, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Policy Support Unit (2010) has recorded a slightly lower share of total export value by SMEs in developing countries vis-a-vis developed countries. \n\n\n\nThis research investigates the different factors influencing SMEs\u2019 decision to internationalise in developing countries (such as Malaysia). This research also examines the relationship between the SME internationalisation adoption and its business performance since the relationship remains vague (Kuivalainen and Sundqvist, 2007; Lu and Beamish 2006; and Zahra et al., 2000). Furthermore, the study deepens understanding of the complex interrelationship between internationalisation determinants (that influence top management\u2019s decision to internationalise) and how such factors (internal and external) have an impact upon SME\u2019s business performance. \n\n\n\nThis paper underlines the following research questions: i) what are the different determinants impacting internationalisation adoption of Malaysian SMEs? ii) how the integration of internal and external determinants impact internationalisation adoption by Malaysian SMEs? iii) what is the role of ethics attributes in influencing Malaysian SMEs\u2019 decision to internationalise? iv) what are the impacts of internationalisation adoption on Malaysian SMEs\u2019 financial and non-financial performance? \n\n\n\nThis research has designed the research methodology based on the post-positivist approach to achieve the research aims and answer the research questions. The triangulation approach was started from an in-depth literature review by systematically stratifying previous research studies in the field. The researcher subsequently conducted semi-structured interviews to purify the findings in the extant literature. 20 vii Malaysian experts including Malaysian internationalising SMEs and public officials were interviewed during the purification phase. The research samples were selected purposefully from a publicly available export directory which was obtained from Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE) website. \n\n\n\nThis research has developed the research framework and hypotheses based on the findings of exploratory interviews. The following step tested the framework through empirical research to prove its validity in explaining SMEs\u2019 internationalisation in Malaysia. A mix of online and mail survey questionnaire was conducted to test the research hypotheses empirically. Finally, the research analysed 218 survey data in various statistical techniques including Cronbach-Alpha test, simple linear regression, multiple regression, structural equation modelling (SEM) and one-sample t-test. \n\n\n\nThis study found that factors influencing internationalisation of Malaysian SMEs vary. While all measures related to entrepreneur/ human capital, firm and environmental attributes have a significant positive relationship to internationalisation adoption, the measures related to ethics attributes are found not impacting internationalisation adoption by Malaysian SMEs. However, the research found environmental attributes and perceived level of internet fraud mediate the relationship between firm attributes and internationalisation adoption by Malaysian SMEs. Finally, internationalisation adoption is found positively significant in impacting the financial and non-financial performance of SMEs in Malaysia. \n\n\n\nThis research will contribute to the academic activities, practitioners and policymakers. For academic activities, research contribution is about understanding the different factors impact on internationalisation adoption, which several factors are yet, undiscovered in Malaysia such as ethics attributes and management entrepreneur orientation (as discussed in chapter 3 and chapter 11). Furthermore, this research contributes to fulfilling the limited number of study in determining difference factors of Malaysian SMEs internationalisation by adopting a holistic research approach involving quantitative and qualitative methods. Also, it contributes to differentiating internationalisation determinants across sectors as previous literature concentrated only upon the manufacturing sector in Malaysia context. Furthermore, the research expands the integrative model of understanding SME internationalisation by Coviello viii and McAuley (1999) in investigating the role of ethics attributes in internationalisation adoption which have never been studied. For practitioners, this research provides a guideline to entrepreneurs or managers who look for determinants that can accelerate internationalisation process of their firms. Also, internationalised SMEs may use the result of this research as a guideline to strengthen their firms and to be more competitive in foreign markets. Policymakers, government and business support agencies may also benefit from this study regarding accommodating the most appropriate support to SMEs who wish to diversify their business abroad, which in turn, will help the government in increasing country\u2019s GDP performance and providing more employability opportunities for citizens", "datePublished": "2019-01-05T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2019, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/189365205.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189365205.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/189365205", "http://www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk/7274/", "http://www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk/7274/1/PhD%20Thesis.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Wahid, Nurbaiti", "Zamzuri, Hairi", "Hassan, Nurhaffizah", "Azizi Abdul Rahman, Mohd"], "title": "Potential Field Based Motion Planning with Steering Control and DYC for ADAS", "description": "In this study, the development of motion planning and control for collision avoidance driver assistance systems is presented.

The correlation thus introduced is exploited at the receiver to enhance the physical layer performance of the system by using multiple-symbol observation detector. Three subclasses of g- CPFSK mapper, single-h CPFSK, multi-h CPFSK, and asymmetric multi-h CPFSK mappers, are considered; although the class of g-CPFSK mapper comprises of a large class of mappers. The resulting OFDM signals and their properties are examined. The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) characteristics of these signals in conjunction with three PAPR reduction techniques, namely, Selective Mapping (SLM), Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), and Clipping and Filtering (CF) are also investigated. Maximum Likelihood (ML) multiple-symbol detection of OFDM signals in AWGN is addressed and the structure of the optimum detector/demapper is derived using the criterion of minimum probability of Bit Error Rate (BER). Closed-form expression for BER of this detector is derived in terms of high-SNR upper and lower bounds. It is noted that BER is a function of: i) Eb=No, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR); ii) parameters of the g-CPFSK mapper; iii) n, observation length of the receiver; and iv) M, number of levels used in the mapper. Finally, the performance of OFDM system with g-CPFSK mapper is evaluated over nonfrequency selective Rayleigh and Nakagami-m fading channels. It is shown that OFDM system with single-h and multi-h CPFSK mappers in conjunction with PTS technique can be designed to achieve PAPR reductions of 6.1 dB and 3.5 dB, respectively, relative to corresponding OFDM system with conventional BPSK mapper. However, when SLM technique is used, PAPR reductions of 1.6 dB and 1 dB, respectively, can be achieved. Asymmetric multi-h and multi-h CPFSK mappers in conjunction with CF technique can be designed to realize PAPR reductions of 4.1 dB and 2.5 dB, respectively, with 25% clipping. Optimum sets of mapper parameters for single-h, multi-h and asymmetric multi-h CPFSK mappers are determined that minimize BER of the system. It is observed that the optimum asymmetric multi-h and multi-h CPFSK mappers outperform BPSK mapper by nearly 2.2 dB and 1.4 dB, respectively, when 4- symbol observation length detector is used. However, it is noted that the complexity of the detector increases as a function of observation length and the type of mapper used.

To address the problem, the former Department of Education (DoE) developed new programmes called the National Certificate Vocational NC (V) for the students of the Further Education and Training colleges (FETs), which were renamed the Technical Vocational Educational and Training Colleges (TVET). The TVET programmes were implemented with the collaboration of industry and other stakeholders who were involved when the NC (V) programmes were developed to ensure their buy-in. Despite all these efforts, Magnus et al. (2013) are of the view that the vocationally-oriented NC (V) programmes offered at colleges are not useful, work-focused and flexible, as a result some leading employers reject the products of the programmes. Returning to the global debate, Lewis (2009) contends that failure of vocational programmes anywhere ought not to be taken as an indictment of vocationalism.\r\nBased on the above scenario, this study surveyed and traced TVET graduates who graduated from 2009 to 2012, to determine the impact of the NC (V) programme on those who decided to either further their studies or be employed. Although the programmes offered by the FET\u2019s are rolled out in various study fields throughout the country, the research was limited to graduates who were enrolled in the following three programmes in the North West Province: building construction, electrical, and engineering related studies. The three mega FET Colleges, composed of more than ten campuses as listed in point 1.2.1, are spread throughout the province, which is regarded to be predominantly rural even though it boasts the biggest hub of mines, especially platinum mines. There is also high concentration of tourism industry as well as agricultural businesses that require a skilled labour force to drive economic activities. An extensive literature review was conducted to appropriately inform the study and to provide a firm basis for the arguments. The NC (V) programmes by their nature and design are closely related to the work of the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs) with respect to the apprenticeships and the learnerships. Factors relating to the research scope, context and the geographical environment were analysed to ensure proper delineation and delimitation of the study since it covered only the North West Province of South Africa. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research methodologies for the collection of data. An interview schedule was used for the collection of the qualitative data from the Colleges, Department of Higher Education and Training, the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs), the Universities of Technologies (UoTs), and the various employer organizations. The questionnaire was applied to collect quantitative data from the graduates because of their large numbers. The use of both methods, the qualitative and quantitative, enhanced the quality of the verification and the validation of the data.\r\nThe correlational relationship and connection between the NC (V) graduates and their post college destinations was determined. This refers to the correlation between NC (V) graduates and the opportunities seized after their college studies. Charles (1998:11) attests that \u201calthough in most cases data for correlation studies are obtained through measurement, at times they come from judgments made by researchers, teachers, or other qualified persons\u201d. In line with this, the researcher presented the findings from the qualitative method in a manner that outlines the opinions and the post college status of the graduates. The findings of the qualitative method provided background knowledge into the NC (V) programmes, the graduates and their destinations, thereby validating the quantitative findings. A work integrated learning framework model is proposed for the enhancement of the FET College curriculum, for the improvement of quality work-placement and for the promotion of partnership amongst the beneficiaries; graduates, employers, colleges and the intermediaries.Educational Leadership and ManagementD.

Examination and optimisation of this feedback loop enables control of industrially important thermal, electrical and engineering properties of \u03b2-Sialon based ceramics.\n\nThe effects of a range of additives on the nitridation and sintering of \u03b2-Sialon composite bodies have been studied and the chemical and mechanical properties of the sintered bodies have been measured. The additives can be divided in three groups: nitridation additives which improve the yield and the rate of the reaction; sintering aids; and additives that improve resistance to thermal shock. A suite of additives consisting of a mixture of calcium aluminate cement, yttrium aluminium garnet and boron nitride was found to deliver an optimum set of mechanical properties with a fracture toughness achieved of over 4 MPa.m-1/2.\n\nThis thesis also reports a new reaction path for the formation of a \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composite by the reaction bonding of aluminium powder coated with nanosized titania. In this novel technique, the aluminium reacts under an inert atmosphere with titania to form alumina and a TixAly intermediate which is then nitrided to form aluminium nitride and titanium nitride. The addition of a suitable silicon phase enables the formation of a \u03b2-Sialon phase under nitrogen at high temperature. The TiN was added in the range 1 to 10 wt% (0.6 to 6 vol%).\n\nThe effects of milling time on the aluminium powder particle size distribution and reactivity have been studied, with a minimum of two days milling time required to modify the particle shape and reduce melting coagulation during firing. Firing parameters have been optimised, using XRD and MAS-NMR to monitor the samples\u2019 composition and SEM to observe their microstructure. The reduction of titania by aluminium was completed at 900 \u00baC for 4 hours in an argon atmosphere and the nitridation of the titanium aluminide at 1400 \u00baC for 3 hours in a nitrogen flow. The nitridation and sintering of the \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composite were both performed in nitrogen at 1400 \u00baC and 1600 \u00baC, respectively. A low level of addition of TiN (1 wt%) has shifted the composition toward the AlN corner of the Sialon behaviour diagram, forming \u03b1-Sialon and AlN polytypes. Other levels of addition in the studied range formed a dense \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composite. The TiN inclusions are found at the grain boundaries but are of insufficient volume fraction to form a continuous network in the Sialon matrix.\n\nMechanical and electrical properties of the newly fabricated \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composites have been measured. These properties were generally improved by the highest levels of TiN addition: Young\u2019s modulus (up to 210 GPa), hardness (up to 17.7 GPa), fracture toughness (up to 3.3 MPa.m-1/2) and compressive strength (up to 188 MPa). However the presence of TiN had no impact on the resistance to thermal shock and electrical conductivity of the \u03b2\u2212Sialon.\n\nFinally, the oxidation process for \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composites has been observed by a combination of XRD, SEM and Ion Beam Analysis techniques. The results show early enrichment of yttrium and titanium in the first 0.1 \u03bcm of the samples\u2019 surface; replacement of nitrogen by oxygen to form crystalline phases on the surface and in the glassy phase up to 1.5 \u03bcm deep; and, major crystalline and chemical changes in an outer layer of about 100 \u03bcm thickness at 1200 \u00baC. The partial depletion of SiO species from the external sample surface during sintering firing leaves this surface zone more vulnerable to oxidation than the protected body of the ceramic. The oxidation of TiN forms a TiO\u2082 skin which acts as a protection from further oxidation.\n\nThe outcome of this research is a novel reaction path to fabricate new advanced Sialon composites and an improved understanding of the effect of a broad range of additives on the nitridation and sintering behaviour of \u03b2-Sialon and \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composites", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Victoria University of Wellington Library'", "subjects": ["Doctoral", "Text"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/41339443.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/41339443", "http://hdl.handle.net/10063/4167"]}, {"authors": ["Tom Rogers", "Ksenia Chmutina"], "title": "Past and Present Green Economy Initiatives and Capacity Building and Financial Mechanisms for the Future Development of the Barbados Energy Sector", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-37753-2_18", "publisher": "'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'", "subjects": ["book-chapter"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/189951169.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/189951169.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/189951169", "https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/10255/13/Rogers%26Chmutina_green%20economy.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Kindangen, R.

Their proximity to human populations in urban centres evokes the need to fully characterise the occurrence of PHE and their dynamics within and between these media.\n\nThis research has provided a detailed characterization of Manchester\u2019s soils and RDS in terms of geochemistry, mineralogy and spatial variability by using the quantification and statistical comparison of the presence of PHE in soils and RDS; and by exploring their spatial, geochemical and mineralogical linkages.\n\nSoil and RDS geochemical analysis shows that maximum PHE concentrations are often well above the dataset median values and established guidelines, indicating that contamination is present at many locations especially for Cr (max. soil 1238, RDS 544 mg/kg), Ni (max. soil 148, RDS 82.4 mg/kg), Cu (max. soil 2073, RDS 493 mg/kg), Zn (max. soil 1763, RDS 1325 mg/kg) and Pb (max. soil 2758, RDS 2027 mg/kg). RDS contamination is closely related to the proximity of present-day sources; whereas soil contamination derives mainly from historical sources and the accumulation of trace metals over long periods of time. SEM-EDS analysis of soil and RDS grains reveal the presence of natural and anthropogenic-related grains in different proportions, and the detailed characterization of PHE-bearing grains shows that these, by their morphology of size, are likely to impact human and ecosystem health. In RDS, grain size and speciation analyses provided a further insight on the availability and summer/winter variations of PHE in this media - whereas total extractable concentrations are higher in winter RDS, also due to their generally small grain size, exchangeable and reducible concentrations are higher in summer, when coarse fractions are predominant. Multivariate and spatial statistical analyses reveal that element associations in soils and RDS are diverse and attributed to a plethora of sources (e.g. industry; vehicle-related sources such as automotive electronics, the wear and tear of tyres and car parts, and car servicing and repair businesses; wastewater treatment plants; historical industry and coal-related sources) through the mapping of component scores and the modelling of PHE concentrations by OLS and GWR. These techniques evidence the differences and similarities between element groupings for soils and RDS and are a powerful tool to aid source apportionment.\n\nThis research has contributed to a better understanding of the complex controls on PHE dynamics in urban systems, adding vital information to the assessment of risks posed by PHE exposure on human health", "datePublished": "2014-03-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Manchester Metropolitan University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/161888825.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/161888825.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/161888825", "http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/332165/", "http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/view/creators/Cardoso=3ARaquel_Braga_da_Silva_Morais=3A=3A.html", "https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/332165/1/PhD_RCardoso_FINAL.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Hasan, A., Dr.", "Bokoro, Pithou, Mr."], "title": "Electrical Engineering II", "description": "Exam paper for National Diploma Engineering: Electrical, and, Engineering: Computer Systems; Summer SSA Examination 201", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Exam paper"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/73933275", "http://hdl.handle.net/10210/64228"]}, {"authors": ["Arash Amini", "Michael Unser"], "title": "Sparsity and Infinite Divisibility", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/tit.2014.2303475", "publisher": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)", "subjects": ["journal-article"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/208056922.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/208056922.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/208056922", "http://bigwww.epfl.ch/publications/amini1401.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Pitz-Paal, Robert"], "title": "Capacity building", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Konferenzbeitrag", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/18462216.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18462216.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/18462216", "https://elib.dlr.de/86261/", "https://elib.dlr.de/86261/1/20131120_KSA-workshop_CapacityBuilding_Input__final.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Lopez, Sofia Alejandra"], "title": "Political economy of labor organization in post-revolution Egypt", "description": "Thesis (M.C.P.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Urban Studies and Planning, 2013.Cataloged from PDF version of thesis.Includes bibliographical references (p. 105-114).The last decade in Egypt has witnessed significant innovations in the structure of social organizations spurred by the fraying of central government legitimacy. Within this dense network of new social actors independent labor unions have emerged as some of the more innovative groups, commanding material assurances and institutional change from firms and on occasion central and municipal governments. Understanding how this happens entails a historical view of Egypt's political economy, and the changes engendered by a succession of leaders beginning in 1952. The Nasser leadership in many ways constituted a reaction to the dynamics of colonialism, though much of Egypt's history since has been similarly premised on negotiating relationships with foreign creditors and domestic demands. In the face of these complex relationships there are and have been a set of local actors successfully making claims and influencing the state in spite of the popular reading of an ironclad regime, impervious to social influence. Building on labor action and social movement theory, the limitations to the sites and kinds of institutional change enacted by workers are clear. Nonetheless, in Egypt these groups are acting in new and surprising ways, defying assumptions about group identity, building strategic partnerships with related religious and pro-democratic organizations, and exerting pressure on a variety of state institutions. This thesis seeks to understand the strategic choices these unions are employing in recruitment, negotiation, and direct action and in particular their relationships to other movements.by Sofia Alejandra Lopez.M.C.P", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/18320862.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/18320862.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/18320862", "http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/81650"]}, {"authors": ["University of Johannesburg"], "title": "Electrical Engineering II", "description": "Exam paper for National Diploma Engineering: Electrical, and, Engineering: Computer Systems; Summer SSA Examination 201", "subjects": ["Exam paper"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/43585932", "http://hdl.handle.net/10210/64228"]}, {"authors": ["Goldin, Dina", "Burshtein, David"], "title": "On the Finite Length Scaling of Ternary Polar Codes", "description": "The polarization process of polar codes over a ternary alphabet is studied.\nRecently it has been shown that the scaling of the blocklength of polar codes\nwith prime alphabet size scales polynomially with respect to the inverse of the\ngap between code rate and channel capacity.

Each uses an empirically tractable model of the behavior of economic agents, along with data on decisions taken by a sample of these agents, to learn about the determinants of choice and how they interact with the market environment. The first chapter provides an introduction. Chapters 2 and 3 present models of consumer demand and firm competition in markets characterized by differentiated product oligopoly. In Chapter 2 we focus on junk food markets and study the effects on market equilibrium and welfare of banning junk food advertising. We model the impact of advertising on consumer demand in a flexible but empirically tractable way, we allow for the pricing response of firms in the market, and we carefully consider the impact of the ban on welfare. Much of the literature using discrete choice models of consumer demand make strong assumptions about the nature of income effects. In Chapter 3 we discuss restrictions that these assumptions place on the shape of demand and on welfare effects, and we explore the empirical consequences of relaxing them in an application in which we simulate the introduction of an excise tax. In Chapter 4 we consider how corporate income taxes affect where firms choose to legally own intellectual property. We estimate a discrete choice model of firm location choice and use the estimates to simulate the effects of the recent introduction of preferential tax treatment for income arising from patents. The question we address in Chapter 5 is how well are consumers able to adjust their choice behavior to deteriorating economic conditions.

In single device of fixed composition (Au/P3HT/Al as spun and processed in air), the measured MR strongly depends on the drive conditions. The magnetoconductance (MC) varies from negative to positive (-0.4% \u2264 MC \u2264 0.4%) with increasing current density, depending on which microscopic mechanism dominates. The negative MC is due to bipolaron based interactions and the positive MC to triplet-polaron based interactions (as confirmed by light emission). Oxygen doping is prevalent in P3HT devices processed in air and the effect of de-doping (by annealing above the glass transition temperature) is investigated on the MC of an Au/P3HT/Al diode. De-doping reduces the current through the device under forward bias by ~3 orders of magnitude, but increases the negative (low current) MC from a maximum of -0.5% pre-annealing to -3% post-annealing. This increased negative MC is consistent with bipolaron theory predictions based on Fermi level shifts and density of states (DoS) changes due to de-doping. The decrease in current density is explained by increased injection barriers at both electrodes also resulting from de-doping. Deliberate chemical doping of P3HT is carried out using pentacene as a hole trap centre. The trapping effect of pentacene is confirmed by reproducible and significant hole mobility-pentacene concentration behaviour, as measured by dark injection (DI) transient measurements. The enhanced carrier injection resulting from the pentacene doping also leads to increased electroluminescence (EL). The resultant MC in pentacene doped devices is strongly dependent on carrier injection and can be significantly enhanced by doping, for example from -0.2% to -0.6% depending on device and drive conditions. Throughout this thesis Lorentzian and non-Lorentzian function fitting is carried out on the measured MC, although the underlying microscopic mechanisms cannot always be discerned.China Scholars Council (CSC); Queen Mary University of Londo", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Queen Mary University of London'", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/77039069.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/77039069.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/77039069", "http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/8940"]}, {"authors": ["Taylor, AC", "Vagaska, B", "Edgington, R", "H\u00e9bert, C", "Ferretti, P", "Bergonzo, P", "Jackman, RB"], "title": "Biocompatibility of nanostructured boron doped diamond for the attachment and proliferation of human neural stem cells", "description": "OBJECTIVE: We quantitatively investigate the biocompatibility of chemical vapour deposited (CVD) nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) after the inclusion of boron, with and without nanostructuring. The nanostructuring method involves a novel approach of growing NCD over carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that act as a 3D scaffold. This nanostructuring of BNCD leads to a material with increased capacitance, and this along with wide electrochemical window makes BNCD an ideal material for neural interface applications, and thus it is essential that their biocompatibility is investigated. APPROACH: Biocompatibility was assessed by observing the interaction of human neural stem cells (hNSCs) with a variety of NCD substrates including un-doped ones, and NCD doped with boron, which are both planar, and nanostructured. hNSCs were chosen due to their sensitivity, and various methods including cell population and confluency were used to quantify biocompatibility. MAIN RESULTS: Boron inclusion into NCD film was shown to have no observable effect on hNSC attachment, proliferation and viability. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of nanostructured boron-doped NCD is increased upon nanostructuring, potentially due to the increased surface area. SIGNIFICANCE: Diamond is an attractive material for supporting the attachment and development of cells as it can show exceptional biocompatibility. When boron is used as a dopant within diamond it becomes a p-type semiconductor, and at high concentrations the diamond becomes quasi-metallic, offering the prospect of a direct electrical device-cell interfacing system", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1088/1741-2560/12/6/066016", "subjects": ["Article"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79500699.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79500699.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/79500699", "http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1477381/", "http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1477381/1/jne_12_6_066016.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Straathof, Bas", "Gailard-Ladinska, Elina", "Kox, Henk", "Mocking, Remco", "Goldberg, Itzhak", "Jensen, Camila", "Lindholm, Peter", "Sobolewski, Maceij", "Berg-Andersson, Brigitta", "Kaseva, Hannu", "Rouvinen, Petri", "Valkonen, Tarmo", "Sellner, Richard", "Sch\u00f6npflug, Karin", "Paterson, Iain"], "title": "A Study on R&D Tax Incentives; Final Report; Study on behalf of the European Commission, TAXUD ; in consortium with CAPP, CASE, CEPII, ETLA, IFO, IFS.", "datePublished": "2014-11-28T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Research Report", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/212123501.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/212123501.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/212123501", "https://irihs.ihs.ac.at/id/eprint/3404/", "https://irihs.ihs.ac.at/id/eprint/3404/1/40698_Study-R%26D-Tax-Incentives-TAXUD-Dec2014.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Raunio, Jukka-Pekka"], "title": "Quality Characterization of Tissue and Newsprint Paper based on Image Measurements; Possibilities of On-line Imaging", "description": "The paper industry is at a turning point worldwide. The consumption of printed products is assumed to decrease significantly because of electronic gadgets and the internet. Furthermore, the importance of forests and woods in the global warming issue is significant and causes limitations to papermakers to produce cheap products. However at the same time the end users demand high quality products at reasonable prices. Therefore, the cost-efficiency in papermaking process will play a more significant role in the future.\n\nThis thesis proposes a set of image analyses and methods which can be implemented in present on-line imaging systems, without a massive effort. The imaging systems can measure the paper accurately and in a versatile manner which improves the control of the paper machine and thus enhances the cost efficiency of the papermaking process.\n\nThe creping process which generates the wavy microstructure to tissue paper - a creping pattern - mainly determines the quality properties of the tissue paper. This thesis applied the photometric stereo method with 2D spectral analysis to characterize the versatile properties of creping pattern. The creping process also affects the free fiber ends and pinholes in tissue paper. The free fiber end detection method was based on the number of shadows of fibers. The shadows were made visible by removing the creping pattern from the images of tissue paper with photometric stereo method. The pinhole detection method was based on the linearly polarized light transmitted through paper and the camera with rotating polarizer. It is anticipated based on the thesis that the characteristics of creping patterns and the number of pinholes are possible to be measured on-line by using existing imaging technology in paper machines.\n\n\nThe web inspection systems installed on paper machines measure the web-wide light transmittance of paper. At present they detect and classify defects such as holes and dirt particles and estimate some simple paper characteristics such as light transmittance and formation. This thesis proposed methods to utilize the on-line transmittance images more versatile in newsprint grade. The cross directional shrinkage profile and the small scale structural characteristics such as the light transmittance, formation, length scale of formation and orientation parameters of paper were estimated based on the statistical measures and the features of frequency distribution in the 2D spectrum. The uncertainty of basis weight estimate approximated from the transmittance images was studied with correlation analysis and the Kubelka-Munk equations. It was noticed that the initial quality of the on-line images was insufficient for evaluating formation characteristics and basis weight reliably. However capturing a complete set of calibration and reference images will also enable the formation and basis weight estimation of paper and thus increasing the value of web inspection system significantly", "datePublished": "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Tampere University of Technology", "subjects": ["fi=Artikkeliv\u00e4it\u00f6skirja | en=Doctoral dissertation (article-based) |", "doctoralThesis"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/250167279.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/250167279.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/250167279", "https://trepo.tuni.fi//handle/10024/115172"]}, {"authors": ["Macdonald, Catriona L."], "title": "The shopfloor experience of regional policy: work and industrial relations at the Bathgate motor plant, c.1961-1986", "description": "This thesis explores the experience of work and industrial relations at the British Motor Corporation\u2019s commercial vehicle assembly plant at Bathgate in West Lothian, from its establishment in 1961 until its closure in 1986. The plant opened in Scotland as a result of a government regional development policy which sought to create jobs and ameliorate the rundown of heavy industry in areas of high unemployment. The thesis considers the role of such policy in shaping industrial development since 1945, and, using the oral history testimony of former Bathgate workers to examine the impact of economic and social change on Scotland\u2019s industrial population, contributes to the regional policy literature by extending the analysis beyond questions about its efficacy and considering the experiences of the workers and communities directly affected by such initiatives.\n\n\n\nWhat emerges from this study of regional policy from the perspective of the shopfloor is the extent to which the plant\u2019s establishment on a greenfield site, in an area of high unemployment, very much on the periphery of the UK motor industry and with little tradition of mass assembly production processes, shaped the subsequent evolution of its working conditions, industrial relations, and worker attitudes, as well as its position within the Bathgate community. The Bathgate experience therefore illuminates a number of key debates in the wider historiography of Britain and Scotland since 1945, not only in relation to regional policy itself, but also with regard to the motor industry, its industrial relations, and the development, in the post-war context of relatively high wages and the increasing stability of work, of a more typically \u2018affluent\u2019 working class.\n\n\n\nThe thesis is divided into two parts. Part One explores some of the issues surrounding the plant\u2019s establishment in West Lothian, particularly the regional policy aspects, and the plant\u2019s position within and relationship to both the wider BMC \u2013 later British Leyland \u2013 organisation and the British motor industry more generally. Part Two draws extensively on the influential \u2018affluent worker\u2019 thesis, as well as the literature around the industrial relations of motor manufacturing, in developing and exploring questions related to the way in which work was experienced at Bathgate, and the extent to which the attitudes and behaviour of its workforce came to reflect those which typified the motor worker elsewhere. Throughout, the thesis engages with and adds nuance to debates over the role of shopfloor organisation and strike activity in damaging the performance of British motor manufacturing, and, by drawing on the oral testimony of former Bathgate workers themselves, offers a fresh perspective on the post-war experience of regional policy both in a particular, under-researched regional policy plant, and in Scotland and Britain more broadly", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/293043833.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/293043833.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/293043833", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4638/1/2013macdonaldphd.pdf", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4638/"]}, {"authors": ["Nur Mardhiyah, Aziz"], "title": "A model for organisational readiness in information technology (IT) project implementation in the Malaysian\n\nconstruction industry / Nur Mardhiyah Aziz", "description": "In a highly competitive environment, it is imperative for the construction industry (CI)\n\nto adopt IT/IS to stay ahead.

People issues are clearly\n\nsignificant, yet neglected, and need to be considered for successful IT/IS\n\nimplementation. Thus, to measure people readiness or capabilities of an organisation\n\nprior to new implementation of IT/IS is extremely important to ensure its successful\n\nimplementation. This study begins with reviewing several e-readiness models that have\n\nbeen developed to measure readiness or capabilities by various groups and institutions.\n\nSeveral limitations have revealed that such models were restricted to assess the current\n\ncapabilities without indicating previous achievements and recommendations for\n\nimprovement. Furthermore, majority of the available readiness models for IT/IS\n\nimplementation does not focus directly on the people issues specifically for the CI.\n\nTherefore, this research attempt to address these limitations by focusing on the people\n\nreadiness issues in the CI. A People e-Readiness Maturity Model (PeRMM) was\n\ndeveloped to assist the construction organisation to successfully implement IT/IS by\n\nidentifying their readiness level prior to IT/IS investments. Prior to developing the\n\nPeRMM, people critical success factors (CSFs) were identified through the literatures\n\ndated from year 2000 to 2013, which reveal 21 people CSFs. Seven IT managers were\n\nselected to participate in the pilot study to confirm the existence of the 21 CSFs\n\nobtained. Findings from the pilot study revealed two additional people CSFs; personal\n\nmanagement competencies and independent. The 23 people CSFs were then used to\n\ndesign the questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was sent to 1000 Malaysian\n\nconstruction organisations ranging from small to large-sized, and received 31.1%\n\niv\n\nresponses. Several analysis were performed in shortlisting the people CSFS to be\n\nincluded in the preliminary people e-readiness maturity model. Subsequently, 5\n\nconstruction organisations participated in the validation exercise to validate the model\n\nwith current practices.

A structured questionnaire was administered among quantity surveyors, architects, engineers, builders and clients in Nigeria. The respondents were asked to give rating, on a 5 point Likert scale, on usual skills and competencies required of quantity surveyors. A secondary objective of the study was to examine the important skills and competencies and categorized them into core skill, basic skill, core competence, optional competence and special competence. The results of the study indicate the important skills as computer literacy, building engineering, information technology, economics, measurement/quantification and knowledge of civil/heavy engineering works.

In this paper, both auto- and cross-correlation models of shadow fading in HSR environments are proposed based on a large set of measurements with 6146 cells in China. The measurements are conducted using a practically deployed and operative Global System for Mobile Communications-Railway (GSM-R) system at 930 MHz to reflect the real conditions of shadow fading in HSR environments. Seven typical HSR environments and the realistic base station (BS) parameters are considered in the analysis. It is found that the decorrelation distance is correlated with the standard deviation (STD) of shadow fading and is generally larger than 100 m in most HSR environments. The cross correlation of shadow fading between two neighboring BSs depends on the BS height and the tilt angle of the antenna, and a heuristic truncated Gaussian distribution model of cross correlation is proposed. The model is validated by the measurements conducted in another operative HSR line. The results can be used to exploit the simulation algorithms to analyze the signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) properties and to develop new and better handover schemes for HSRs", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/TVT.2014.2351579", "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/article"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/34089358.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34089358.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/34089358", "http://hdl.handle.net/2078.1/166756"]}, {"authors": ["Font Aragon\u00e8s, Xavier"], "title": "Visible, near infrared and thermal hand-based image biometric recognition", "description": "Biometric Recognition refers to the automatic identification of a person based on his or her anatomical characteristic or modality (i.e., fingerprint, palmprint, face) or behavioural (i.e., signature) characteristic. It is a fundamental key issue in any process concerned with security, shared resources, network transactions among many others. Arises as a fundamental problem widely known as recognition, and becomes a must step before permission is granted. It is supposed that protects key resources by only allowing those resources to be used by users that have been granted authority to use or to have access to them. Biometric systems can operate in verification mode, where the question to be solved is Am I who I claim I am? or in identification mode where the question is Who am I?\r\nScientific community has increased its efforts in order to improve performance of biometric systems. Depending on the application many solutions go in the way of working with several modalities or combining different classification methods. Since increasing modalities require some user inconvenience many of these approaches will never reach the market. For example working with iris, face and fingerprints requires some user effort in order to help acquisition.\r\nThis thesis addresses hand-based biometric system in a thorough way. The main contributions are in the direction of a new multi-spectral hand-based image database and methods for performance improvement. The main contributions are:\r\nA) The first multi-spectral hand-based image database from both hand faces: palmar and dorsal. Biometric database are a precious commodity for research, mainly when it offers something new like visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR) and thermography (TIR) images at a time. This database with a length of 100 users and 10 samples per user constitute a good starting point to check algorithms and hand suitability for recognition.\r\nB) In order to correctly deal with raw hand data, some image preprocessing steps are necessary. Three different segmentation phases are deployed to deal with VIS, NIR and TIR images specifically. Some of the tough questions to address: overexposed images, ring fingers and the cuffs, cold finger and noise image.\r\n\r\nOnce image segmented, two different approaches are prepared to deal with the segmented data. These two approaches called: Holistic and Geometric define the main focus to extract the feature vector. These feature vectors can be used alone or can be combined in some way. Many questions can be stated: e.g. which approach is better for recognition?, Can fingers alone obtain better performance than the whole hand? and Is thermography hand information suitable for recognition due to its thermoregulation properties? \r\nA complete set of data ready to analyse, coming from the holistic and geometric approach have been designed and saved to test. Some innovative geometric approach related to curvature will be demonstrated.\r\nC) Finally the Biometric Dispersion Matcher (BDM) is used in order to explore how it works under different fusion schemes, as well as with different classification methods. It is the intention of this research to contrast what happen when using other methods close to BDM like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). At this point, some interesting questions will be solved, e.g. by taking advantage of the finger segmentation (as five different modalities) to figure out if they can outperform what the whole hand data can teach us.El Reconeixement Biom\u00e8tric fa refer\u00e8ncia a la identi caci\u00f3 autom\u00e0tica de persones fent us d'alguna caracter\u00edstica o modalitat anat\u00f2mica (empremta digital) o d'alguna caracter\u00edstica de comportament (signatura). \u00c9s un aspecte fonamental en qualsevol proc\u00e9s relacionat amb la seguretat, la compartici\u00f3 de recursos o les transaccions electr\u00f2niques entre d'altres. \u00c9s converteix en un pas imprescindible abans de concedir l'autoritzaci\u00f3. Aquesta autoritzaci\u00f3,\r\ns'ent\u00e9n que protegeix recursos clau, permeten aix\u00ed, que aquests siguin utilitzats pels usuaris que han estat autoritzats a utilitzar-los o a tenir-hi acc\u00e9s. Els sistemes biom\u00e8trics poden funcionar en veri caci\u00f3, on es resol la pregunta: Soc jo qui dic que soc? O en identi caci\u00f3 on es resol la q\u00fcesti\u00f3: Qui soc jo?\r\nLa comunitat cient\u00ed ca ha incrementat els seus esfor\u00e7os per millorar el rendiment dels sistemes biom\u00e8trics. En funci\u00f3 de l'aplicaci\u00f3, diverses solucions s'adrecen a treballar amb m\u00faltiples modalitats o combinant diferents m\u00e8todes de classi caci\u00f3. Donat que incrementar el n\u00famero de modalitats, representa a la vegada problemes pels usuaris, moltes d'aquestes aproximacions no arriben mai al mercat.\r\nLa tesis contribueix principalment en tres grans \u00e0rees, totes elles amb el denominador com\u00fa seg\u00fcent: Reconeixement biometric a trav\u00e9s de les mans.\r\ni) La primera d'elles constitueix la base de qualsevol estudi, les dades. Per poder interpretar, i establir un sistema de reconeixement biom\u00e8tric prou robust amb un clar enfocament a m\u00faltiples fonts d'informaci\u00f3, per\u00f2 amb el m\u00ednim esfor\u00e7 per part de l'usuari es construeix aquesta Base de Dades de mans multi espectral. Les bases de dades biom\u00e8triques constitueixen un recurs molt preuat per a la recerca; sobretot si ofereixen algun element nou com es el cas. Imatges de mans en diferents espectres electromagn\u00e8tics: en visible (VIS), en infraroig (NIR) i en t\u00e8rmic (TIR). Amb un total de 100 usuaris, i 10 mostres per usuari, constitueix un bon punt de partida per estudiar i posar a prova sistemes multi biom\u00e8trics enfocats a les mans.\r\nii) El segon bloc s'adre\u00e7a a les dues aproximacions existents en la literatura per a tractar les dades en brut. Aquestes dues aproximacions, anomenades Hol\u00edstica (tracta la imatge com un tot) i Geom\u00e8trica (utilitza c\u00e0lculs geom\u00e8trics) de neixen el focus alhora d'extreure el vector de caracter\u00edstiques. Abans de tractar alguna d'aquestes dues aproximacions, per\u00f2, \u00e9s necess\u00e0ria l'aplicaci\u00f3 de diferents t\u00e8cniques de preprocessat digital de la imatge per obtenir les regions d'inter\u00e8s desitjades. Diferents problemes presents a les imatges s'han hagut de solucionar de forma original per a cadascuna de les\r\ntipologies de les imatges presents: VIS, NIR i TIR. VIS: imatges sobre exposades, anells, m\u00e0nigues, bra\u00e7alets.  NIR: Ungles pintades, distorsi\u00f3 en forma de soroll en les imatges   TIR: Dits freds\r\nLa segona \u00e0rea presenta aspectes innovadors, ja que a part de segmentar la imatge de la ma, es segmenten tots i cadascun dels dits (feature-based approach). Aix\u00ed aconseguim contrastar la seva capacitat de reconeixement envers la ma de forma completa. Addicionalment es presenta un conjunt de procediments geom\u00e8trics amb la idea de comparar-los amb els provinents de l'extracci\u00f3 hol\u00edstica.\r\nLa tercera i \u00faltima \u00e0rea contrasta el procediment de classi caci\u00f3 anomenat Biometric Dispersion Matcher (BDM) amb diferents situacions. La primera relacionada amb l'efectivitat respecte d'altres m\u00e8tode de reconeixement, com ara l'An\u00e0lisi Lineal Discriminant (LDA) o b\u00e9 m\u00e8todes com KNN o la regressi\u00f3 log\u00edstica. Les altres situacions que s'analitzen tenen a veure amb m\u00faltiples fonts d'informaci\u00f3, quan s'apliquen t\u00e8cniques de normalitzaci\u00f3 i/o estrat\u00e8gies de combinaci\u00f3 (fusi\u00f3) per millorar els resultats. \r\nEls resultats obtinguts no deixen lloc per a la confusi\u00f3, i s\u00f3n certament prometedors en el sentit que posen a la llum la import\u00e0ncia de combinar informaci\u00f3 complement\u00e0ria per obtenir rendiments superiors.Postprint (published version", "datePublished": "2013-05-30T00:00:00", "publisher": "Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya", "subjects": ["Doctoral thesis"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81575884.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/81575884", "http://hdl.handle.net/10803/117685", "http://hdl.handle.net/2117/94940"]}, {"authors": ["Tom Rogers", "Ksenia Chmutina"], "title": "Past and Present Green Economy Initiatives and Capacity Building and Financial Mechanisms for the Future Development of the Barbados Energy Sector", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-37753-2_18", "publisher": "'Springer Science and Business Media LLC'", "subjects": ["book-chapter"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/191333790.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/191333790.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/191333790", "https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/10255/13/Rogers%26Chmutina_green%20economy.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Bridges, Paul W, II"], "title": "The Bombs Bursting In Air:  A History Of The Effects of Atmospheric Nuclear Weapons Testing On Washington County, Utah, 1951-1963", "description": "This thesis explores the effects of atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site from 1951-1962 on Washington County, Utah, specifically focusing on the effects of these detonations on the local population, the local flora and fauna, and the ensuing impact of political and economic forces.

By way of both conceptual and empirical challenge, this paper highlights flows of end-of-life goods from the global North towards the global South.  This involves the disassembly and destruction of goods to recover secondary resources for further rounds of commodity production.  Global recycling networks take things of rubbish value (often spent or \u2018end-of-life\u2019 goods) and turn them back into resources in other places and production networks.  They operate not through adding value, but by connecting different regimes of value.

Previously, the technology needed to accurately measure physiologic change within the larynx and breath-support musculature during the process of singing simply did not exist. Any prior application of scientific study to the voice was based primarily upon auditory evaluation, rather than objective data accumulation and assessment. After a centuries-long history, within a span of twenty years, vocal pedagogy evolved from an approach solely derived from subjective, auditory evidence to an application grounded in scientific data. By means of analysis of significant publications by Richard Miller, Robert Sataloff, and Ingo Titze, as well as articles from The Journal of Singing and The Journal of Voice, I establish a baseline of scientific knowledge and pedagogic practice ca. 1980. Analysis and comparison of a timeline of advancement in scientific insight and the discussion of science in pedagogical texts, 1980-2000, reveal the extent to which voice teachers have dramatically changed their method of instruction. I posit that voice pedagogy has undergone a fundamental change, from telling the student only what to do, via auditory demonstration and visual imagery, to validating with scientific data how and why students should change their vocal approach. The consequence of this dramatic pedagogic evolution has produced singers who comprehend more fully the science of their art.Dissertation/ThesisD.M.A. Music 201", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Doctoral Dissertation"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/79566430.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79566430.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/79566430", "http://hdl.handle.net/2286/R.I.17726"]}, {"authors": ["Eurofound"], "title": "Representativeness of the European Social Partner Organisations: Electricity Sector", "description": "This study provides information designed to aid sectoral social dialogue in the electricity sector.

The design, testing, and improvement of the V2V system hinge critically on the understanding of the propagation channels. An important feature of the V2V channel is the time variance. To statistically model the time-variant V2V channels, a dynamic wideband directional channel model is proposed in this paper, based on measurements conducted at 5.3 GHz in suburban, urban, and underground parking environments. The model incorporates both angular and delay domain properties and the dynamic evolution of multipath components (MPCs). The correlation matrix distance is used to determine the size of local wide-sense stationary (WSS) region. Within each WSS time window, MPCs are extracted using the Bartlett beamformer. A multipath distance-based tracking algorithm is used to identify the \u201cbirth\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d of such paths over different stationarity regions, and the lifetime of MPC is modeled with a truncated Gaussian distribution. Distributions for the number of multipaths and their positions are statistically modeled. Within each path lifetime, the initial power is found to depend on the excess delay, and a linear polynomial function is used to model the variations within the lifetime. In addition, a Nakagami distribution is suggested to describe the fading behavior. Finally, the model implementation is validated by comparison of second-order statistics between measurements and simulations", "datePublished": "2015-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/TIE.2015.2459376", "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/article"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/34089334.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34089334.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/34089334", "http://hdl.handle.net/2078.1/167106"]}, {"authors": ["Juntong Chen", "Rongyao Ling", "Hongjie Ni", "Dan Zhang"], "title": "Distributed Fault Estimation of Nonlinear Networked Systems: Application to Robotic Manipulator", "datePublished": "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1155/2014/121636", "publisher": "'Hindawi Limited'", "subjects": ["journal-article"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/186730108.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/186730108.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/186730108", "http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2014/121636.pdf", "http://doi.org/10.1155/2014/121636"]}, {"authors": ["null null"], "title": "Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education: A guide to record series supporting epidemiologic studies conducted for the Department of Energy", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.2172/481525", "publisher": "'Office of Scientific and Technical Information  (OSTI)'", "subjects": ["report"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/193940397.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/193940397.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/193940397", "https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc680772/m2/1/high_res_d/481525.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Juntong Chen", "Rongyao Ling", "Hongjie Ni", "Dan Zhang"], "title": "Distributed Fault Estimation of Nonlinear Networked Systems: Application to Robotic Manipulator", "datePublished": "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1155/2014/121636", "publisher": "'Hindawi Limited'", "subjects": ["journal-article"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/192790189.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/192790189.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/192790189", "http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2014/121636.pdf", "http://doi.org/10.1155/2014/121636"]}, {"authors": ["null null", "null null"], "title": "Special Analysis for the Disposal of the Consolidated Edison Uranium Solidification Project Waste Stream at the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site, Nevada National Security Site, Nye County, Nevada", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.2172/1062672", "publisher": "'Office of Scientific and Technical Information  (OSTI)'", "subjects": ["report"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/194841187.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/194841187.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/194841187", "https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc844229/m2/1/high_res_d/1062672.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Szyszkowitz, Tessa"], "title": "Book review: Germany, Russia, and the rise of geo-economics", "description": "Germany, Russia, and the rise of Geo-Economics by Stephen F.

This position paper provides a collation of current work in international standards and highlights the drivers for the necessary change required to address patient safety in the use of healthcare IT software and systems. Software development and deployment has already altered and standards to oversee these are only just catching up. The need to revise such standards has been recognised and is underway, however a clash of cultures is delaying the emergence of Standards traditionally developed and governed by Standards Development Organisations (SDOs). The impact of this is that whilst standards are being informed by current software trends, the standards developers themselves are struggling to assimilate the rapid changes in the market. Whilst SDOs are cooperating more closely, there is an increased need for the involvement of the healthcare software development community and e-health informaticians in the standards process to narrow the gap in standards relevance.

Understanding how to effect this technological change is therefore imperative if the challenge of climate change is to be addressed. The literature is replete with technology and policy studies investigating technologies, policy instruments and processes of technological change, however, surprisingly little research has addressed the broader political economy context within which any technological change will need to be realised. This research investigates linkages between the sort of systematic environmental technological change implied by the imperative of climate change mitigation and the broader political economy context.\n\n\n\nFirstly, considering evolutionary economics approaches to understanding technological change, we argue that evolutionary micro-foundations lend themselves to an analysis of political economy processes. Moreover, it is a direct consequence of evolutionary microfoundations that technological change, and particularly that linked with structural change in an economy, is likely to have important political economy implications. Secondly, we show how heterodox approaches to understanding structural change and development in economic systems are consistent with evolutionary micro-foundations and allow the development of an analytical framework based upon an understanding of the process of economic rent creation and preservation. Thirdly, we apply these insights to a critical reconstruction of the evidence on the development of the electricity services industry (ESI), illustrating the importance of political economy considerations in understanding technological and institutional change in that sector. Finally, we apply these insights to a detailed case study of the ESI in Vietnam, investigating the ways in which political economy factors have influenced the broader development of the sector, and examining how the choice of specific technologies is likely to be affected by political economy of the sector", "datePublished": "2014-02-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/29111002.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29111002.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/29111002", "https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/51521/", "https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/51521/1/Sawdon.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Macdonald, Catriona L."], "title": "The shopfloor experience of regional policy: work and industrial relations at the Bathgate motor plant, c.1961-1986", "description": "This thesis explores the experience of work and industrial relations at the British Motor Corporation\u2019s commercial vehicle assembly plant at Bathgate in West Lothian, from its establishment in 1961 until its closure in 1986. The plant opened in Scotland as a result of a government regional development policy which sought to create jobs and ameliorate the rundown of heavy industry in areas of high unemployment. The thesis considers the role of such policy in shaping industrial development since 1945, and, using the oral history testimony of former Bathgate workers to examine the impact of economic and social change on Scotland\u2019s industrial population, contributes to the regional policy literature by extending the analysis beyond questions about its efficacy and considering the experiences of the workers and communities directly affected by such initiatives.\n\n\n\nWhat emerges from this study of regional policy from the perspective of the shopfloor is the extent to which the plant\u2019s establishment on a greenfield site, in an area of high unemployment, very much on the periphery of the UK motor industry and with little tradition of mass assembly production processes, shaped the subsequent evolution of its working conditions, industrial relations, and worker attitudes, as well as its position within the Bathgate community. The Bathgate experience therefore illuminates a number of key debates in the wider historiography of Britain and Scotland since 1945, not only in relation to regional policy itself, but also with regard to the motor industry, its industrial relations, and the development, in the post-war context of relatively high wages and the increasing stability of work, of a more typically \u2018affluent\u2019 working class.\n\n\n\nThe thesis is divided into two parts. Part One explores some of the issues surrounding the plant\u2019s establishment in West Lothian, particularly the regional policy aspects, and the plant\u2019s position within and relationship to both the wider BMC \u2013 later British Leyland \u2013 organisation and the British motor industry more generally. Part Two draws extensively on the influential \u2018affluent worker\u2019 thesis, as well as the literature around the industrial relations of motor manufacturing, in developing and exploring questions related to the way in which work was experienced at Bathgate, and the extent to which the attitudes and behaviour of its workforce came to reflect those which typified the motor worker elsewhere. Throughout, the thesis engages with and adds nuance to debates over the role of shopfloor organisation and strike activity in damaging the performance of British motor manufacturing, and, by drawing on the oral testimony of former Bathgate workers themselves, offers a fresh perspective on the post-war experience of regional policy both in a particular, under-researched regional policy plant, and in Scotland and Britain more broadly", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/211234774.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/211234774.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/211234774", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4638/1/2013macdonaldphd.pdf", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4638/"]}, {"authors": ["B\u00fcschemann, Arne"], "title": "Managerial and organizational efficiency : applied econometrics in professional team sports", "description": "Die vorliegende empirische Dissertation untersucht verschiedene Forschungsfragen im Bereich der Sport\u00f6konomie.

Therefore, I have gathered data sets from various professional sports, including data about the team-level financial and sport performance of four North American major sport leagues: the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), National Football League (NFL), and Major League Baseball (MLB), as well as from English Premier League (EPL) clubs. I use detailed individual player performance and salary data related to players in the German Bundesliga. My analyses also rely on game- and season-level data from the Spanish basketball top division Asociaci\u00f3n de Clubs de Baloncesto (ACB). I start with an initial assessment of the uncertainty of outcome hypothesis by empirically detailing the trade-off between scoring and competitive balance in professional basketball. The following chapter addresses the financial performance of NHL franchises, prior and after a new collective bargaining agreement in 2005, which provides a unique setting in which to analyze the impact of a regulatory intervention on managerial efficiency. Subsequently, I extend the efficiency analysis to all North American Major League franchises and clubs from the English Premier League to investigate the differences in motives between North American and European sport teams, as well as how sporting performance might differentially influence teams value and revenues. The next chapter analyzes how the consistency of professional soccer players performance might affect their salaries. Finally, the last chapter offers a broader focus and integrates another field of research, by analyzing the effects of environmental regulations on foreign direct investment patterns of German multinational enterprises.Tag der Verteidigung: 23.03.2015Paderborn, Univ., Diss., 201", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis", "DoctoralThesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/50521509.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/50521509.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/50521509", "https://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:466:2-16092"]}, {"authors": ["Skotnes, Ruth \u00d8stgaard"], "title": "Challenges for safety and security management of network companies due to increased use of ICT in the electric power supply sector", "description": "PhD thesis in Risk management and societal safetyThe generation, transmission, and distribution of energy are among the most vital prerequisites for the functioning of modern societies (Antonsen et al., 2010). Today, information and communication technology (ICT) is used to monitor, control, and operate power generation plants and power\r\ndistributionon within electric power supply systems (Patel and Sanyal, 2008). Process control systems, e.g., supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA systems) and other ICT systems used within electric power supply systems, are vulnerable to a multitude of physical, electromagnetic, and\r\nlogical threats, both natural and man-made (Rodal, 2001). The recent trends are toward more general purpose software solutions; and toward use of the Internet for communication related to operations and management of remote processes and production systems. This increases efficiency\r\nand cooperation, saves time, and reduces costs. However, this also makes formerly isolated ICT systems vulnerable to a set of threats and risks they have not been exposed to before (Line and T\u00f8ndel, 2012).\r\nSince the early 1990s, the energy sectors of Western societies have been through a process of institutional restructuring, where large state-owned monopolies have been divided into several independent organizations (Antonsen et al., 2010). Emergent control technologies, making intensive use of ICT, have been useful for dealing with the new situation of enlargement, open access,\r\nprogressive integration of electricity markets, and intensification of cross-border trade. However, the full application of these technologies has demanded a new approach to system design and operation, and their integration within existing control infrastructures and practices has been a challenge (The GRID Consortium, 2007).\r\nWith this background as a point of departure, the thesis examines several important elements of safety and security management systems which have been emphasized in previous research (Rasmussen, 1997; Hagen, Albrechtsen, and Hovden, 2008; Renn, 2014; Aven et al., 2004), i.e., government risk regulation, the use of technical standards for safety and security, risk perception among managers and employees, management commitment to safety and security, and awareness\r\ncreation and training with regard to safety and security. The aim of the study is to follow up on previous research on challenges for safety and security management and to explore, describe, and discuss challenges for safety and security management of network (distribution/grid) companies within the electric power sector that arise due to the increased use of ICT to monitor, control, and\r\noperate electric power production and distribution. Thus, the main aim of the thesis is to answer the following question:\r\nWhat challenges for safety and security management of network companies within the\r\nelectric power sector have arisen in light of the increased use of ICT to monitor, control,\r\nand operate electric power production and distribution?\r\nSpecific research questions have been derived from the main aim, and these research questions are addressed in the four articles included in the thesis.\r\nThe context for the study is the Norwegian electric power supply sector, and the research\r\nquestions are answered by presenting results from a survey sent to 137 network (distribution/grid)\r\ncompanies in Norway, supplemented by results from interviews, observation studies, and document\r\nstudies. The thesis focuses on companies involved in transmission and distribution of electricity, and not generation (production). The generation system in the Norwegian electric power supply consists\r\nof many power stations distributed over the whole country. The structure is thus relatively robust, and the dependence on individual plants is small (Fridheim, Hagen, and Henriksen, 2001). However, a\r\nfailure in the electricity networks and the transmission and distribution of electricity to critical infrastructures and important societal functions, as well as to individual households, would have a huge impact on societal safety (and security).\r\nThis thesis concentrates on organizational safety and security (risk) management within electric power supply network companies. However, network companies run critical national infrastructure, and the safety and security management of these companies can thus affect societal safety and security. Safety and security management of network companies is also affected by national\r\nregulations, and there is no longer a clear distinction between national regulations and safety and security management of network companies. Ideas about internal control and risk management have been increasingly commingled, and risk management and regulation are no longer seen as broadly\r\ncontrasting methods of assuring safety and security (Power, 2007).\r\nThe results of the study show that finding the best balance between the use of detailed,\r\nprescriptive regulation versus functional regulation (self-regulation/internal control) as principles for\r\ncontrolling risk and ensuring safety and security is a challenge for the safety and security\r\nmanagement of the network companies. Next, the thesis finds that technical standards for management of ICT safety and security pose a challenge for the network companies. These standards have both strengths and weaknesses, and both use and non-use of these standards can lead to\r\nchallenges for the safety and security management of the network companies. The study also suggests that users (both managers and employees) of ICT systems (including SCADA systems) within the electric power supply network companies perceive the risk of attacks on or malfunctions in these\r\nsystems as low, which can present a challenge for the safety and security management of the companies. Furthermore, the study finds a statistically significant correlation between management\r\ncommitment to ICT safety and security and implementation of awareness creation and training measures in the companies; however, the use of awareness creation and training measures for ICT safety and security varies quite a bit among the network companies. The lack of awareness of a\r\ndanger might lead to weak vigilance by users and a greater potential for abuse, which can be a challenge for safety and security management. The thesis also highlights that one main factor \u2012complexity \u2012 influences all the different challenges studied.\r\nThe theoretical framework for the thesis (i.e., the sociotechnical perspective and institutional organizational theory) has helped to contextualize the studied phenomena, highlight aspects and elements that are important to consider in relation to safety and security (or risk) management, and\r\nshow that many different factors can lead to challenges for safety and security management at every level of the sociotechnical system. The thesis illustrates why it is important to consider human,\r\ntechnological, and organizational factors, as well as the dynamic interaction between these factors. It is especially important to consider cultural-cognitive factors and be aware of how these elements affect safety and security management. Institutional organizational theory contributes to illustrate\r\nthat there is no clear distinction between organizations and their environments and that many socially constructed and institutionalized aspects can influence organizations and create important challenges. Regulative (regulations), normative (technical standards), and cultural-cognitive (sensemaking, risk perception, commitment, and awareness) processes are connected in complex\r\nand changing mixtures, and these processes shape organizational structures and activities. The use of institutional organizational theory also sheds light on the important fact that many issues related to safety and security seem to be taken for granted", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "University of Stavanger, Norway", "subjects": ["Doctoral thesis"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52129678.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52129678.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/52129678", "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/no/", "http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2374441"]}, {"authors": ["Emil Jovanov", "Mladen Milosevic", "Aleksandar Milenkovic"], "title": "A mobile system for assessment of physiological response to posture transitions", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/embc.2013.6611220", "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "subjects": ["proceedings-article"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/192986689.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/192986689.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/192986689", "http://www.ece.uah.edu/~milenka/docs/embc13_imWell.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["W W Hays", "R A Mueller", "Jr, C T Spiker"], "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE ANALYSIS OF SEISMIC DATA FROM CRATERING AND CONTAINED EVENTS.

Under the strong control of a\r\nsingle Commissioner the efficiency of officers was\r\njudged by examinations and the reports of inspectors\r\nbut procedural difficulties and central control\r\nirritated permanent heads. At the same time public\r\nservice associations, grown strong after gaining access to the Arbitration Court were demanding promotion appeal rights. On the recommendation of McLachlan in his Royal Commission Report, promotion power was transferred to permanent heads in the new Public Service Act of 1924 while the new Board (which replaced the Commissioner) determined promotion appeals of officers through the enquiries of Inspectors. The new Board also devised a classification of narrow salary ranges. Under the new system departments like the P.M.G's formulated their promotion procedures. But the depression greatly reduced promotion opportunity and returned soldiers were flooding the Commonwealth service under statutory preferences. The associations agitated for an appeal committee system instead of inspectorial enquiry in promotion appeals.\r\nDuring all these years Victoria had a single\r\nCommissioner but Ministerial control of service economy reduced his powers in practice and promotion opportunity was very low. New South Wales started with a strong Board and the Allard Royal Commission recommendations in 1918 made it stronger. Both state services suffered as much as the Commonwealth service during the depression.\r\nThe second world war showed up the need for\r\na new type of official leader ship and strengthened the service associations who won some of their demands.\r\nIn the Commonwealth service, the Bailey Committee\r\nrecommended enquiry in to promotion appeals by appeal\r\ncommittees. In New South Wales, a new open Court was\r\ncreated to hear appeals, while in Victoria the\r\nassociation succeeded in getting an independent\r\npowerful Board with a service representative. in the current period of expansion all the\r\nthree services have quite high rates of promotion and\r\nthe professional officers are particularly favoured in\r\nmany ways. m the Commonwealth service each department\r\nhas its own variations in promotion procedure; the\r\nauthorities feel the need for a new concept of\r\nefficiency but there is no unified movement or\r\ndirection. in all the services, employer- employee\r\nrelations are smooth.

Within-word pause placement is not random, but is restricted to certain affix boundaries; it requires that the paused-after material be at least dimoraic, and that the remaining material in the verbal word be at least disyllabic. Bininj Gun-wok, another polysynthetic language closely related to Dalabon, does not allow pauses to interrupt the verbal word, and the Dalabon development appears to be tied up with certain morphological innovations that have increased the proportion of closed syllables in the pronominal prefix zone of the verb. Though only incipient and not yet phonologized, pause placement in Dalabon verbs suggests a phonology-driven route by which polysynthetic languages may ultimately become less morphologically complex by fracturing into smaller units", "datePublished": "2015-12-07T09:44:31", "doi": "10.1515/LING.2008.004", "publisher": "'Walter de Gruyter GmbH'", "subjects": ["Journal article"], "year": 2015, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/156633726", "http://hdl.handle.net/1885/21611", "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/21611/7/U1454988XPUB1_evans.pdf.jpg", "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/21611/9/Big_words%252C_small_phrases_-Evans_-_e-version.pdf.jpg", "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/21611/11/01_Evans_Big_words%2C_small_phrases%3A_2008.pdf.jpg", "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/21611/13/02_Evans_Big_words%2C_small_phrases%3A_2008.pdf.jpg", "https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/21611/16/01_Evans_Big_words%2C_small_2008.pdf.jpg"]}, {"authors": ["Chandra, Anshu M."], "title": "Foreign direct investment and the stages of sector diversification", "description": "Foreign direct investment (FDI), when considered homogenous, has case-specific result on sector diversification.

However, it is generally recognised that while a range of pathways have been created, the numbers of students involved in such pathways are relatively limited. This paper explores some of the reasons this might be so, using, as a case study, an analysis of a national Australian government policy initiative. The initiative, known as \u2018VET FEE-HELP\u2019, involved the introduction of student loans for fees for higher-level VET studies and was designed partly to encourage credit transfer. Availability of loans to students was on the proviso that the course in which the student enrolled had a documented pathway providing credit transfer into a higher education course. This created a climate in which VET providers actively pursued partnerships with higher education. But recently, the credit transfer requirement of the policy has been removed. The paper concludes by discussing the issues for governments in finding appropriate policy levers to increase proportions of students transferring from VET to higher education.C", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1080/13596748.2014.897517", "subjects": ["Text", "Journal article"], "year": 2014, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/212998603.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/212998603.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/212998603", "https://doi.org/10.1080/13596748.2014.897517", "http://researchonline.federation.edu.au/vital/access/HandleResolver/1959.17/63126"]}, {"authors": ["Mohsin, Omar Q."], "title": "Mobile Robot Localization Based on Kalman Filter", "description": "Robot localization is one of the most important subjects in the Robotics science.

In my thesis, I want to present a solution to find the best estimate for a robot position in certain space for which a map is available. The thesis started with an elementary introduction to the probability and the Gaussian theories. Simple and advanced practical examples are presented to illustrate each concept related to localization. Extended Kalman Filter is chosen to be the main algorithm to find the best estimate of the robot position. It was presented through two chapters with many examples. All these examples were simulated in Matlab in this thesis in order to give the readers and future students a clear and complete introduction to Kalman Filter.\nFortunately, I applied this algorithm on a robot that I have built its base from scratch. MCECS-Bot was a project started in Winter 2012 and it was assigned to me from my adviser, Dr. Marek Perkowski. This robot consists of the base with four Mecanum wheels, the waist based on four linear actuators, an arm, neck and head. The base is equipped with many sensors, which are bumper switches, encoders, sonars, LRF and Kinect. Additional devices can provide extra information as backup sensors, which are a tablet and a camera. The ultimate goal of this thesis is to have the MCECS-Bot as an open source system accessed by many future classes, capstone projects and graduate thesis students for education purposes.\nA well-known MRPT software system was used to present the results of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). These results are simply the robot positions estimated by EKF. They are demonstrated on the base floor of the FAB building of PSU.

While technology advancements were designed to be contributing to minimising task complexity, issues such as fatigue, increased administrative burden and technology assisted accidents still plague the industry. In spite of the clearly recognisable benefits of using modern technology in the management of ships, in practice its application appears lacking by a considerable margin. The main driver of the study was to appreciate the cause of this disparity.\r\nThe study first reviewed a wide body of literature on issues involving the use of technology which included academic literature with empirical evidences and theoretical explanations of implementation of technology at work. With the help of the extant knowledge this research embarked on providing an explanation to the gap that existed in the application of technology in the shipping industry. By taking a case study approach the thesis looked into the induction and integration of technology in the management and operation of ships that primarily interfaced closely between the ship and its management unit on shore. Three companies with mutually diverse management setup were studied. The fourth case comprised of purposefully selected senior members of ships\u2019 staff. \r\nThe analysis of the data revealed that the manifestation of the gap in technology implementation is caused by deeper influences at work in the shipping industry. The un-optimised technology integration results in the seafarer, who is the keystone to the technology application, becoming a victim of the circumstances. The technology that was intended to ease operations and burdens ends up in controlling him, even leaving him under-resourced and causing fatigue.This was not an unintended outcome but the result of weak regulatory practices, short-term capital outlook and weakened labour practices in the shipping industry all caused by wider social and economic developments affecting not just this industry but businesses globally. The impact of such influences was however more acute in this industry resulting in such extreme consequence. \r\nBy bringing to light the limited application of some fundamental principles of human-systems integration, this study has attempted to expand the boundaries of research on the subject and contributed to the holistic understanding of the various underlying factors that influence technology integration in ship management processes", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "'University of Plymouth'", "subjects": ["Doctorate"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/29818752.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29818752.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/29818752", "http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/2840"]}, {"authors": ["Ji, Liang", "Booth, Campbell", "Dysko, Adam", "Kawano, Fumio", "Beaumont, Phil"], "title": "Improved fault location through analysis of system parameters during auto-reclose operations on transmission lines", "description": "This paper describes a novel single-ended impedance-based fault-location method for transmission lines, which is based upon the analysis of voltage and current during discrete system states that arise during the operation of single- and three-phase autoreclose schemes.

Examination and optimisation of this feedback loop enables control of industrially important thermal, electrical and engineering properties of \u03b2-Sialon based ceramics.\n\nThe effects of a range of additives on the nitridation and sintering of \u03b2-Sialon composite bodies have been studied and the chemical and mechanical properties of the sintered bodies have been measured. The additives can be divided in three groups: nitridation additives which improve the yield and the rate of the reaction; sintering aids; and additives that improve resistance to thermal shock. A suite of additives consisting of a mixture of calcium aluminate cement, yttrium aluminium garnet and boron nitride was found to deliver an optimum set of mechanical properties with a fracture toughness achieved of over 4 MPa.m-1/2.\n\nThis thesis also reports a new reaction path for the formation of a \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composite by the reaction bonding of aluminium powder coated with nanosized titania. In this novel technique, the aluminium reacts under an inert atmosphere with titania to form alumina and a TixAly intermediate which is then nitrided to form aluminium nitride and titanium nitride. The addition of a suitable silicon phase enables the formation of a \u03b2-Sialon phase under nitrogen at high temperature. The TiN was added in the range 1 to 10 wt% (0.6 to 6 vol%).\n\nThe effects of milling time on the aluminium powder particle size distribution and reactivity have been studied, with a minimum of two days milling time required to modify the particle shape and reduce melting coagulation during firing. Firing parameters have been optimised, using XRD and MAS-NMR to monitor the samples\u2019 composition and SEM to observe their microstructure. The reduction of titania by aluminium was completed at 900 \u00baC for 4 hours in an argon atmosphere and the nitridation of the titanium aluminide at 1400 \u00baC for 3 hours in a nitrogen flow. The nitridation and sintering of the \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composite were both performed in nitrogen at 1400 \u00baC and 1600 \u00baC, respectively. A low level of addition of TiN (1 wt%) has shifted the composition toward the AlN corner of the Sialon behaviour diagram, forming \u03b1-Sialon and AlN polytypes. Other levels of addition in the studied range formed a dense \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composite. The TiN inclusions are found at the grain boundaries but are of insufficient volume fraction to form a continuous network in the Sialon matrix.\n\nMechanical and electrical properties of the newly fabricated \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composites have been measured. These properties were generally improved by the highest levels of TiN addition: Young\u2019s modulus (up to 210 GPa), hardness (up to 17.7 GPa), fracture toughness (up to 3.3 MPa.m-1/2) and compressive strength (up to 188 MPa). However the presence of TiN had no impact on the resistance to thermal shock and electrical conductivity of the \u03b2\u2212Sialon.\n\nFinally, the oxidation process for \u03b2-Sialon/TiN composites has been observed by a combination of XRD, SEM and Ion Beam Analysis techniques. The results show early enrichment of yttrium and titanium in the first 0.1 \u03bcm of the samples\u2019 surface; replacement of nitrogen by oxygen to form crystalline phases on the surface and in the glassy phase up to 1.5 \u03bcm deep; and, major crystalline and chemical changes in an outer layer of about 100 \u03bcm thickness at 1200 \u00baC. The partial depletion of SiO species from the external sample surface during sintering firing leaves this surface zone more vulnerable to oxidation than the protected body of the ceramic.

In particular extrinsic variability is apt to generate \u201capparent\u201d information that can in extreme cases mask the actual information that would flow between the different molecular components. We show how this artificial inflation in information arises, and how the effects of different types of noise alone and in combination can be understood.\r\nBy applying the same approach to the ERK signalling pathway, we determine the best mechanistic model for this system in question and shed light on the noise filtering capabilities of the system.

However, existing online feature selection methods evaluate\nfeatures individually and ignore the underlying structure of feature stream.\nFor instance, in image analysis, features are generated in groups which\nrepresent color, texture and other visual information. Simply breaking the\ngroup structure in feature selection may degrade performance. Motivated by this\nfact, we formulate the problem as an online group feature selection.

Malicious programs that exploit vulnerabilities also serve as threats to digital investigators. Since digital devices such as computers and networks are used by organisations and digital investigators, malicious programs and risky practices that may contaminate the integrity of digital evidence can lead to loss of evidence. For some reasons, digital investigators face a major challenge in preserving the integrity of digital evidence. Not only is there no definitive comprehensive model of digital forensic investigation for ensuring the reliability of digital evidence, but there has to date been no intensive research into methods of doing so.\nTo address the issue of preserving the integrity of digital evidence, this research improves upon other digital forensic investigation model by creating a Comprehensive Digital Forensic Investigation Model (CDFIM), a model that results in an improvement in the investigation process, as well as security mechanism and guidelines during investigation. The improvement is also effected by implementing Proxy Mobile Internet Protocol version 6 (PMIPv6) with improved buffering based on Open Air Interface PIMIPv6 (OAI PMIPv6) implementation to provide reliable services during handover in Mobile Node (MN) and improve performance measures to minimize loss of data which this research identified as a factor affecting the integrity of digital evidence. The advantage of this is to present that the integrity of digital evidence can be preserved if loss of data is prevented.\nThis research supports the integration of security mechanism and intelligent software in digital forensic investigation which assist in preserving the integrity of digital evidence by conducting experiments which carried out two different attack experiment to test CDFIM. It found that when CDFIM used security mechanism and guidelines with the investigation process, it was able to identify the attack and also ensured that the integrity of the digital evidence was preserved. It was also found that the security mechanism and guidelines incorporated in the digital investigative process are useless when the security guidelines are ignored by digital investigators, thus posing a threat to the integrity of digital evidence", "datePublished": "2013-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.15123/PUB.4982", "publisher": "'Indiana University Mathematics Journal'", "subjects": ["mphil"], "year": 2013, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/219373223.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/219373223.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/219373223", "https://repository.uel.ac.uk/download/ab8ff8088a3b38771734f0218c0404ae9223b469f61d9f62bbfe154e90805669/6610711/INIKPI_ADEMU_FINAL_THESIS%20V2.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.15123/PUB.4982"]}, {"authors": ["Mili\u0107evi\u0107, N."], "title": "Circadian regulation of the retinal pigment epithelium\u2013photoreceptor complex", "datePublished": "2022-04-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376896314.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376896314.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376896314", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/46317615/Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/46317619/Chapter_2.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/46317623/Chapter_4.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/46317631/Appendix.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/46317633/cover.jpg", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/circadian-regulation-of-the-retinal-pigment-epitheliumphotoreceptor-complex(89e381a4-3b4c-494b-b4f1-ab4100a59a24).html", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/89e381a4-3b4c-494b-b4f1-ab4100a59a24", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/46317621/Chapter_3.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/46317629/Chapter_7.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Feng, Ruopei"], "title": "Behavioral analysis and protein folding in zebrafish larvae", "description": "The zebrafish, Danio rerio, is a very important vertebrate model organism with growing popularity in biology and neuroscience. My thesis work covered two topics centered on zebrafish. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 focused on the swimming behavior of the animal. This topic is of great interest because animal behavior is the direct reflection of neural activity. In particular, because of the episodic nature of the swimming behavior of larval zebrafish, the quantitative analysis of its behavior presents potential in bridging behavior and underlying neural control. In Chapter 1, I looked into the escape response behavior in 2D. Combining an objective behavior analysis approach with a simple neurokinematic model, I was able to explain the difference between two types of escape response behavior by the difference in their corresponding neural circuits. The results from my non-invasive analysis agreed with previous findings in invasive electrophysiological studies, in contradiction with some unconstrained swimming studies. In Chapter 2, I extended the swimming behavior analysis into three dimensions. I developed a physical model-based tracking algorithm that captured both fish position and shape in 3D during swim bouts. I analyzed the swimming behavior in a 3D environment and compared with the behavior in 2D. My results showed a distinction between the behavior in 2D and 3D environments and this distinction revealed that past studies in 2D may not faithfully capture the behavioral repertoire of larval zebrafish in the natural environment. In Chapter 3, still using zebrafish as the model organism, I studied protein folding dynamics in differentiated tissues in a living organism. With CPLC postdoc Caitlin Davis, I developed a customized pipeline that integrates meganuclease-mediated mosaic transformation with fluorescence-detected temperature-jump microscopy to probe dynamics and stability of endogenously expressed proteins in different tissues of living zebrafish.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:39:04", "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287625037", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106446"]}, {"authors": ["Operskalski, Joachim Thomas"], "title": "The neural systems supporting human intelligence, as measured by lesion analysis, task activation, and resting state connectivity", "description": "The set structure of human cognitive abilities and their organization in the brain remains as controversial today as it was when the positive manifold between diverse cognitive tests was first explained as being driven by a single capacity for processing information. Alternative explanatory accounts of human intelligence can interpret the same experimental data in support of their competing claims because they do not make testable predictions. Far from being the reductive caricature of itself that some have parodied, cognitive neuroscience is one subfield of psychology (among others) whose methods lend themselves to the generation of testable predictions about how brain structure and function should relate to psychological test performance if different explanatory frameworks were true. This dissertation will explain three experiments on mapping tests of intelligence in the brain: first, a test of analogical reasoning using task-related functional MRI, followed by a test of emotional intelligence using analysis of focal penetrating brain lesions, followed by a test of visuospatial matrix reasoning, or fluid intelligence, using resting state functional MRI. Finally, a chapter on the literature and theoretical considerations about mapping causal reasoning in the brain will close the current discussion.U of I OnlyAuthor requested U of Illinois access only (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "datePublished": "2022-03-02T22:18:25", "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287624890", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106299"]}, {"authors": ["Nam, Yoonkey"], "title": "Engineering Principles to Design and Analyze Patterned Neuronal Cultures Using Multielectrode Arrays", "description": "161 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.This dissertation addresses several issues related to the construction of reliable and reproducible patterned neuronal cultures on planar multielectrode arrays (MEAs) for biological experiments. Discussed problems include multichannel recording and stimulation for multi-dimensional data analysis, the effect of electrode geometry on spike detection, the longevity of patterned cultures on MEAs, reliable extracellular spike detection, interference with astroglial cells in terms of neuronal confinement and spike detection. MEAs were used to record evoked responses as well as spontaneous activity of patterned cultures  in vitro. These cultures showed synchronized bursting activity after 2 weeks and time-locked responses in respond to electrical stimulations. Different electrode configurations were tested to study the relation between cell/electrode coupling and spike waveforms. An epoxy terminated organosilane (3-gylcidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane) was used as an easy and reproducible protein linker that can produce a stable long-lasting cell pattern for the study of patterned network in vitro. Metal electrodes of MEAs were chemically modified with organosilane or alkanethiol based self-assembled monolayers to fabricate cell-attractive electrodes. The electrode modification did not degrade the capability of neural recording, but expected cell migration toward electrodes was not observed. The growth of astroglial cells was characterized by measuring the compliance to underlying protein or neuronal patterns. Majority of astroglial cells stayed near neurons, which resulted in a confined growth of both neurons and astroglial cells. The results in this dissertation are expected to contribute to the development of in vitro model for basic neuroscience or neural prosthesis researches in the future.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158303981", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/80934"]}, {"authors": ["Scheffers, Marten Klaas"], "title": "Performance Monitoring: Error Detection and the Error-Related Negativity in Choice-Related Time Tasks", "description": "129 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1999.Supervisory control is an integral part of the human information processing system. A component of the event-related brain potential, the error-related negativity (ERN), appears to be a manifestation of a process that monitors the accuracy of performance. Current evidence suggests that the component is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex. In choice reaction time tasks, the monitoring process compares a representation of the appropriate (correct) response with a representation of the response actually made. The ERN amplitude reflects the degree of mismatch, i.e. the error signal. In the experiments reported in this thesis, subjects performed a visual search, a memory search and an Eriksen flankers task. The error-related negativity (ERN) was smaller with high search loads, with non-automatized stimulus-response mappings, with extended wakefulness, and with reduced stimulus contrast. These data are consistent with the view that difficulties with target identification compromise the computation of the representation of the appropriate response and the error detection process. Uncertainty about the response that should have been made was also reflected in ratings of performance accuracy. The ERN amplitude was large when subjects believed they were in error. The dependence of performance monitoring on the outcome of stimulus-related processing had implications for the effectiveness of error detection. The data suggest that performance accuracy in conditions of data-limited processing was undetermined, because the representation of the appropriate response was ambiguous. However, errors due to impulsive responding were detected, because continued processing of the stimulus after the response was selected prematurely permitted the representation of the appropriate response to be completely specified. The idea that the ERN is associated with performance monitoring was contrasted with the crosstalk monitoring hypothesis, developed to explain functional blood flow changes in the anterior cingulate cortex. The insensitivity of the ERN to the presence of response competition in the Eriksen flankers task provided little support for the model of crosstalk monitoring. Investigations of supervisory control using the methods of cognitive neuroscience promise to further our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie this critical aspect of human information processing.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291773832", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/82295"]}, {"authors": ["Wever, I."], "title": "Defining mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons:Identifying different levels of transcriptional control", "datePublished": "2024-11-22T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2024, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/381791160.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/381791160.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/381791160", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801150/Chapter_1.pdf", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/defining-mesodiencephalic-dopaminergic-neurons(c4fd4fe1-27ce-46ba-a1f1-1c1fed317fbb).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801164/Addenda.pdf", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/c4fd4fe1-27ce-46ba-a1f1-1c1fed317fbb", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801148/Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801168/cover.jpg"]}, {"authors": ["Pl\u00e9h, Csaba"], "title": "Meddig lesz m\u00e9g sz\u00fcks\u00e9g a pszichol\u00f3gi\u00e1ra? = Until when do we still need psychology?", "description": "A pszichol\u00f3gia a 20. sz\u00e1zad egyik diadalmas tudom\u00e1nya \u00e9s hivat\u00e1sa.

Still, form its onset on doubts are accompanying its possibility, its assumed intellectual sterility, and practical sterility. These doubts reemerge today. However, one is able to ironically refute them not in the name of the oppressed and endangered, but in the light of clearer professional identity.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th Century, the naissant psychology was challenged on the one hand by Comte claiming that its supposed contents could be divided between sociology and neurobiology, while on the other hand by Dilthey, Frege, and Husserl who considered it to be intellectually plain and lacking phantasy. These challenges were dealt with in mid-twentieth century by the three aspect theory of Karl B\u00fchler (experience, behavior, and objectivations) and by the role of cultural mediation in the theory of Lev Vygotsky, and later on by Jean Piaget with his cross disciplinary position of psychology. Amongst these interpretive debates, the show went on undisturbed. During the early stages of the last century the best theoreticians took part in forming the practical profession of modern psychology. Binet, Ebbinghaus, Stern, S. Freud, Lewin, Lurija, Bowlby, while being outstanding theoretical researchers, played a crucial role in the formation of the basic frames of the profession as well, in a similar way as Ferenczi, Szondi, Harkai or M\u00e9rei in Hungary.\n\nThe threats and challenges towards psychology never stopped while professional psychology was being formed. Just think of the dubious victories of Pavlovianism in the East-European countries, or the insatiable hunger of pedagogy this ethernel dedicated formator of humanity.\n\nAll of this is merely the past to be remembered by historians of psychology. On the present day intellectual landscape, psychology is again challenged and questioned form two directions. In science, the new interdisciplinary field seem to digest psychology. Cognitive science, neuro-philosophy, and neuroscience all tend to question the independent future of psychology. Once we would know everything, there will not be anything but neural patterns of excitations, though in fact the real gurus of neuroscience like Gazzaniga and Ramachandran question the victorious nature of the reductionism of their own field. Experimental psychologists should not panic when witnessing the questioning of their existence partly initiated by them. The neural interpretation of man can indeed provide a causal model of behavior, but only the psychological interpretation of behavior can account for what do we have a causal model of, e.g. in the fMRI magnet, is the person reading, flirting, or fighting. And this is further complicated by the subjective experiences of the subject accompanying these behaviors.\n\nThe other threat of today comes from the half-prepared representatives of rival professions, from trainers, coaches, and gurus of all sorts. Present day psychology should clearly see that it is not involved in a freedom fight any more, but it protects a clear professional image. With regard to intellectual reductionisms, it protects the idea that psychological science is supported in its identity by an existing profession, while there are no professions of cognitive scientist, or neuroscientist. Against the half-trained professional rivals it should claim that in the profession of psychology, in line with the ancestors mentioned, theoretical foundations have their place. Psychologists are not technicians or paramedics of behavior, but its engineers and doctors", "datePublished": "2032-06-30T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1556/MPSzle.67.2012.2.1", "publisher": "'Akademiai Kiado Zrt.'", "subjects": ["Article", "PeerReviewed", "info:eu-repo/semantics/article"], "year": 2032, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/154884301", "http://real.mtak.hu/75578/1/mpszle.67.2012.2.1.pdf", "http://real.mtak.hu/75578/"]}, {"authors": ["Z\u00e9t\u00e9nyi, Tam\u00e1s"], "title": "A kreativ\u00edt\u00e1s pszichometri\u00e1ja \u00e9s a gondolkod\u00e1s = Creativity, psychometrics and thinking", "description": "Az el\u0151ad\u00e1s \u00e1ttekint\u00e9st ad a kreat\u00edv k\u00e9pess\u00e9gek m\u00e9r\u00e9s\u00e9nek m\u00f3dszereir\u0151l \u00e9s az elm\u00falt f\u00e9l \u00e9vsz\u00e1zadban el\u00e9rt eredm\u00e9nyeir\u0151l.

The recent data from cognitive neuroscience make it possible to show where this happens in the brain, too.

The prediction of antisocial behavior is particularly relevant in correctional settings, where the assessment of inmates is used for classification, placement, and intervention purposes. This process has been greatly informed by violence risk assessment (VRA), which is designed to develop estimations of risk for specific antisocial behaviors and strategies to reduce this risk. Neuropsychology represents a promising theoretical and empirical basis for enhancing the predictive accuracy of VRA, and therefore its validity in clinical and legal decision making. A prospective incremental validity study was conducted to investigate the ability of neuropsychological measures to predict antisocial behavior in an incarcerated sample. Most of the screening and executive functioning measures did not demonstrate the ability to predict program failure due to major program violation; however, measures conceptualized to assess impulsivity demonstrated predictive validity for program failure, independent of the influence of substance use, and over and above a traditional risk assessment measure. Incarcerated individuals may represent a distinct neuropsychological population of interest for researchers and clinical practitioners.

Il metodo in questione \u00e8 stato proposto originariamente da Jimenez-Monta\u00f1o, Ebeling e altri, ma \u00e8 stato formalizzato nel linguaggio della teoria della probabilit\u00e0 e studiato pi\u00f9 approfonditamente da Grassberger.\nPer spiegare come funziona il metodo NSRPS, supponiamo di avere una sorgente M stazionaria e a stati finiti, ossia un dispositivo che emette stringhe di simboli estratti da un alfabeto finito, in modo tale che la probabilit\u00e0 di ricevere una data stringa finita non vari nel tempo. Data una successione estratta dalla sorgente, il metodo di Grassberger prescrive di individuare la coppia (o una delle coppie) di simboli di maggiore frequenza e di sostituirne tutte le occorrenze non sovrapposte, procedendo da sinistra verso destra, con un nuovo simbolo. Esemplificando, data la stringa s0 = 011010111011000111011010011, estratta da una sorgente stazionaria con alfabeto A = {0,1} per cui tra le probabilit\u00e0 delle coppie di simboli \u00e8 massima quella della coppia '01', sostituiamo ogni occorrenza della sottostringa '01' con il nuovo simbolo '2', ottenendo s1 = 2122112100211212021.\nDopo la prima sostituzione abbiamo una nuova sorgente M1 con alfabeto A1 = {0,1,2}. Possiamo poi ripetere il procedimento introducendo nuovi simboli '3', '4', ..., (ottenendo nuove sorgenti M2, M3, ...\nIl teorema principale riguardo al metodo NSRPS afferma che il procedimento delle sostituzioni di coppie di simboli trasforma, nel limite per il numero di sostituzioni che tende a infinito, qualunque sorgente ergodica in una sorgente 1-markoviana. Equivalentemente, si pu\u00f2 dire che l'entropia di una sorgente ergodica M si pu\u00f2 calcolare, nel limite per il numero n di sostituzioni che tende a infinito, conoscendo solo la distribuzione dei simboli e delle coppie di simboli dopo n sostituzioni.\nIn una sezione della tesi esponiamo nel dettaglio un esempio di processo stocastico a cui vengono applicate le sostituzioni di coppie, nel quale, pur non sostituendo ad ogni passo una coppia di frequenza massima, vale la conclusione del teorema principale, e anzi una condizione ancora pi\u00f9 forte.\nAbbiamo poi applicato il metodo NSRPS per ottenere una stima dell'entropia di trasformazioni ergodiche dell'intervallo [0,1]. Abbiamo a tal fine considerato quattro trasformazioni e confrontato su di esse il metodo NSRPS con altri tre metodi classici di stima: uno che applica direttamente la definizione di entropia; uno che mette in relazione l'entropia alla crescita esponenziale in n dei tempi di ritorno di blocchi simbolici lunghi n; il terzo \u00e8 il calcolo dell'esponente di Lyapunov, il quale, sotto certe condizioni, \u00e8 uguale all'entropia.\nDalle simulazioni al calcolatore, realizzate nel linguaggio di programmazione C con la libreria 'GMP - GNU Multiple Precision' per la gestione di numeri in virgola mobile con precisione arbitraria, traiamo conclusioni sull'efficienza del metodo NSRPS e sulla sua velocit\u00e0 di applicazione per la stima dell'entropia di Kolmogorov-Sinai, oltrech\u00e9 idee per direzioni di indagine future", "datePublished": "2047-11-30T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2047, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/14694628.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/14694628.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/14694628", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-11092007-194317/"]}, {"authors": ["CAPODAGLI, NICOLA"], "title": "Trattamento con tetrabenazina in bambini con paralisi cerebrale discinetica: studio longitudinale di coorte", "description": "La tetrabenazina (TBZ) \u00e8 un depletore selettivo e reversibile delle monoamine, prevalentemente dopamina, dei terminali sinaptici.

TBZ was approved by USA FDA in 2008 as an orphan drug for the treatment of choreiform movements associated with Huntington disease and it is currently being used off-label in the MD therapy. Tetrabenazine (TBZ) has been studied with a variety of hyperkinetic movement disorders, but there is limited and empirical literature on the potential efficacy of TBZ in children with Dyskinetic Cerebral Palsy (DCP). The only published trial on the use of TBZ in paediatric population in CP subjects was performed in 1974 by Heggarty and Wright.\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate TBZ efficacy in a sample of children with DCP using the Movement Disorders- Childhood Rating Scale 4-18 Revised (MD CRS4-18 R). To our knowledge, this study represents the first homogeneous cohort of children with DCP followed up for a 12 months period.\nThe study is a multicentre retrospective study in which the participants were selected from databases of each Italian Centre involved, according detailed inclusion criteria.

Addictive potential of propofol is observed, as well as the impact on the memory process. However, both phenomena are still insufficiently explored. Bearing in mind that adolescence is a period of extreme sensitivity to addictive substances and intense maturation of the mnemonic potential, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of a single exposure to propofol anesthesia, which is a typical method of its clinical application, on dopaminergic signaling, synaptic and neuronal activity in different brain regions and behavior of juvenile/peripubertal rats, as a model system of human periadolescencent development. The effects were analyzed 4, 24 and 48 hours after the treatment, in male Wistar rats aged 35 days.\r\nThe obtained findings for the first time showed that exposure to propofol anesthesia caused changes in the expression/phosphorylation of signal molecules that are already recognized as significant for the action of the addictive substances. Of all the analyzed dopaminoceptive brain regions (medial prefrontal cortex, striatum and thalamus), significant changes in the expression of the phosphorylated/activated form of DARPP-32 protein, indicator of postsynaptic dopaminergic signalling, were observed only in the thalamus, 4 and 24 hours after the treatment, and were accompanied by increased expression of FosB/\u0394FosB protein, a biochemical indicator of neuronal activity. The alterations were localized in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and the mid-dorsal thalamus. An increase in the expression of the phosphorylated form of CaMKII\u03b1, a biochemical sensor of synaptic activity that has an important role in memory on addictive substances exposure, was detected in striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. Reduction in the intensity of anxiety (estimated in accordence to the data obtained in the light/dark box and elevated plus maze tests) was observed 24 hours after the treatment, along with the decrease in the expression of FosB protein in striatum, which can be interpreted as a sensation seeking due to decreased activity of brain region important for a pleasure/motivation. An enhanced motor response to d-amphetamine and phencyclidine was observed 24 hours after the treatment (cross\r\nsensitization), as confirmation that despite the different primary mechanisms of action, propofol and these two drugs use the same neuronal pathways to achieve psychomotor effects. The results of the study also indicated that in peripubertal rats exposed to propofol anesthesia, there were some difficulties in memory retrieval and acquisition of new learning in non-aversive memory tests (spatial habituation, novel object recognition), 24 hours after the treatment. These effects were accompanied by changes in the expression of molecules involved in retrieval and reconsolidation of episodic memory (BDNF/TrkB, Egr-1, ERK1/2, CaMKII\u03b1, FosB/\u0394FosB) in the dorsal hippocampus. Detected difficulties in recognizing the novelty are consistent with a few clinical studies that emphasize the importance of controlling basic cognitive functions in older children after exposure to propofol anesthesia. Also, in all investigated brain regions, except the thalamus, an increase in the expression of the phosphorylated form of Adducin\u03b2 protein was observed, which is an indication of the cytoskelet destabilization and synaptic reorganization.\r\nOverall, the results of this study accentuated that a better understanding of the biological consequences of the use of propofol in juvenile/puberty period could contribute to the undestanding of age-dependent health risks of the treatment, which have been extensively investigated so far only at the extremes of age, i.e. during early postnatal period and in aging.", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "Belgrade: University of Belgrade, Faculty of Biology", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis", "publishedVersion"], "year": 2030, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/162652474.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/162652474.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/162652474", "http://ibiss-r.rcub.bg.ac.rs/123456789/3137", "http://uvidok.rcub.bg.ac.rs/handle/123456789/2787", "http://ibiss-r.rcub.bg.ac.rs//bitstream/id/4477/Pavkovic_Zeljko_dissertation.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Zhao, Rongkai"], "title": "Digitizing a Three-Dimensional Brain Atlas: Image Sequence Alignment and Volumetric Encoding", "description": "149 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.A 3D brain digital atlas is an important tool for neuroscience research. Many different imaging technologies such as MRI, CT, PET, microscopic imaging, and wet section photography, etc., are available. Among the technologies, cryosectioning followed by wet section photography can yield the highest resolution image of a full brain section. However, the images in the raw image sequence are not aligned with each other and therefore must be spatially registered. This dissertation describes several new methods employed by the atlas construction process. The most important components of the image registration process are the objective function and the optimization strategy. Pairwise image registration is inappropriate due to the lack of consideration of global coherence. A novel objective function called minimum entropy of bad prediction (MEBP) is proposed. MEBP is based on information theory and can be used for multi-modal image registration as well as image sequence alignment (ISA). In ISA, MEBP concurrently take multiple images into consideration and therefore can yield better alignment result. The optimization algorithm is a new hybrid method composed of density-based clustering algorithm, multi-resolution method and simplex method. This new method is less data-specific and more suitable for semi-automatic or automatic image registration. The image post-processing and volume compression are other important components in atlas construction. The commonly existed Swiss-cheese type image defect is treated with wavelet-based method and long range correlation. An octree variant, scalable hyperspace file (SHSF), was developed to encode the volumetric data set. SHSF can facilitate volume accessing so that efficient virtual brain slicer and surface viewer are possible to implement. Since a high-resolution brain digital atlas can occupy hundreds of megabytes to tens of gigabytes storage space, in order to support applications on the atlas, volume compression algorithms are necessary. Three compression algorithms for different purposes are proposed. They include lossless method, near-lossless method and progressive lossy-to-lossless method. The progressive method is the most versatile and generalized coder. The various topics covered in this dissertation are compiled into a coherent whole with the digital brain atlas as the central scene.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291773238", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/81701"]}, {"authors": ["Kavanagh, Deirdre"], "title": "Empirical and conceptual analyses of perspective-taking : a behaviour-analytic approach", "datePublished": "2025-02-25T00:00:00", "publisher": "Universiteit Gent.

The aims of this research were to: 1) identify child factors (postural control, reciprocal lower limb movement, functional strength, and motivation) and family factors (family support to child and support to family) that indicate readiness for independent walking; and 2) examine whether a parent reported focus and amount of physical therapy (PT) predicted usual methods of walking in daily settings. Participants in the first study were 80 children with CP, 2-6 years of age. Backward stepwise logistic regression was used to analyze a person-environment model of child and family factors that predicted children\u2019s ability to take steps independently. Functional strength measured in a dynamic sit to stand task that incorporates components of postural control and coordinated body movements was the only variable that predicted taking 3 or more steps independently after one year. The model had a 79% probability of predicting not walking and a 54% probability of predicting walking. Participants in the second study were 84 children with CP, 2-6 years of age, also classified GMFCS levels II-III. For each of four settings, (home, preschool, community, outdoors), multiple linear regression was used to analyze a model of the parent reported focus of PT services on balance activities for postural control, strengthening exercises, transfer training, and mobility training and the amount of PT received. A focus on strengthening exercises was the only significant predictor of walking performance at preschool only, (P<.05), explaining 17% of variance in children\u2019s usual method of walking. The regression model was not predictive of walking at home, inside community buildings, or in outdoors settings. These studies add to previous research supporting strengthening activities for children with CP, indicating that a child who is able to stand from a bench may be ready for a focus on walking, and a focus on strengthening exercises in physical therapy may optimize walking independence in preschool. Future studies measuring child and family factors at frequent intervals are needed to determine precise indicators of readiness for independent walking. Prospective studies are recommended to examine the relationship between strengthening in closed chain functional activities in therapy and during daily activities and children\u2019s usual method of walking in everyday settings. Physical therapists, parents, and other providers are encouraged to provide frequent opportunities for practice of functional strengthening, i.e., sitting to standing from a bench or climbing the ladder on the slide, and other components of walking to promote more independence in walking in young children with CP. Task-specific practice of walking throughout the child\u2019s day may be influenced by the people and settings providing opportunities for practice. Effective collaboration, consultation, and coordination between therapists and others may be indicated to maximize opportunities for walking practice.Ph.D., Rehabilitation Sciences -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201411, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325920.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190325920.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190325920", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6111", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6111"]}, {"authors": ["Bosenbark, Danielle D."], "title": "Attention and Executive Functioning Profiles in Children Following Perinatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke", "description": "Background: Despite its recognition as the most frequent form of stroke in children and being a major source of long-standing neurological sequelae, there is a dearth of research concerning the psychosocial and neuropsychological profile of perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS). Prior research has documented a high incidence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)\u2014a disorder characterized by prominent impairments in attention and executive functioning skills\u2014among children with a history of PAIS, yet there are no prior studies comprehensively investigating this profile in these children. Moreover, medical and neurophysiological factors may contribute to outcomes in these domains are largely understudied in this population. A elevated understanding of the attention and executive functioning profile in PAIS will not only better inform clinicians of the cognitive outcomes, but may also lead to better interventions to address\u2014or strategies for management of\u2014the subsequent sequelae of PAIS. Objectives: The present study sought to: 1) investigate and describe the profile of attention and executive functioning in children following perinatal stroke; and 2) examine the influence of clinical and demographic factors on attention and executive functioning outcomes in children following perinatal stroke. Participants: Forty-one children aged 3-15 diagnosed with perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, recruited from the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Patients were identified through the CHOP Pediatric Stroke Program\u2019s ambulatory patient care clinic and IRB-approved Stroke Registry. Method: Children underwent a single-session neuropsychological assessment focusing on attention and executive functioning domains at CHOP. Additionally, parents/legal guardians completed questionnaires regarding real-world functioning of attention and executive functioning during the visit as well, providing a functional measure of these domains. Demographic (age, sex, race, and family socioeconomic) and medical variables (lesion size, lesion location, presence of epilepsy) were collected for each participant. Results: Although intellectual performance was in the lower normative range (mean = 94.38; SD = 15.90), it was significantly lower than FSIQ in the normative sample. Additionally, measures of attention, verbal fluency, inhibitory control, flexibility/shifting, planning/organizing, and processing speed were significantly lower in children with PAIS than in the normative sample (all p<0.001); working memory was not significantly different. The presence of comorbid epilepsy, larger stroke volume, and older age at time of testing significantly influenced performance on several attention and executive functioning measures, whereas sex, stroke location (anatomical), and stroke laterality did not. Conclusions: Overall, children with PAIS evidenced significant attention and executive functioning impairment in comparison to typically developing peers in the normative population. Children with comorbid epilepsy, larger stroke volume, and/or older age were at increased risk for deficits in these cognitive domains.Ph.D., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201506, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190325412.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190325412.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190325412", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6614", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6614"]}, {"authors": ["Gorsegner, Amanda"], "title": "Role of art in the global climate change movement", "description": "The findings presented in this publication suggest that artists and arts administrators have significant roles to play when using the arts to address climate change.

The contemporary climate change movement requires the integration of artists to respond to the challenges of climate change not merely as buffers between the public and the hard data but to incite a richer and more complex conversation through the cumulative impact of all art that addresses climate change.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201603, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190329787.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190329787.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190329787", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6754", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6754"]}, {"authors": ["Verma, Ajay K.", "Xu, Da", "Garg, Amanmeet", "Blaber, Andrew P.", "Tavakolian, Kouhyar"], "title": "Effect of Aging on Muscle-Pump Baroreflex of Individual Leg Muscles During Standing", "description": "Activation of leg muscles is an important component in the regulation of blood pressure during standing, failure of which could result in syncope and falls. Our previous work demonstrated baroreflex mediated activation of leg muscles (muscle-pump baroreflex) as an important factor in the regulation of blood pressure during standing; however, the effect of aging on the muscle-pump baroreflex of individual leg muscles during standing remains to be understood. Here, the interaction between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the activation of lateral gastrocnemius (LG), medial gastrocnemius (MG), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus (SOL) muscles during standing was quantified. Beat-to-beat heart period (RR interval), SBP, electromyography impulse (EMGimp) were derived from continuously acquired electrocardiography, finger blood pressure, and calf-electromyography, respectively.

The three experiments presented here examine the idea that some typically-studied language processes are composed of distinct contributions from each hemisphere, but that other processes require input from both hemispheres in order to be successfully engaged. Using event-related brain potentials, these studies explore individual and joint contributions of the two hemispheres over time during the comprehension of normal, plausible sentences. In order to bias processing to one hemisphere, sentence-final words are presented in the contralateral half of the visual field. Hemispheric asymmetries and symmetries are examined across several cognitive processing mechanisms, including those at perceptual, semantic, and later processing stages. Results show that, consistent with prior work, normal semantic processing as indexed by the N400 seems to reflect a combination of the processing biases of the two hemispheres. Rather than being composed of independent hemispheric contributions, some later processing stages of comprehension, dubbed semantic revision, seem to require hemispheric cooperation. Finally, the experiments show that the processing biases are flexible, as different experimental contexts lead to recruitment of the hemispheric biases to differing degrees. Understanding how the hemispheres cooperate over time during language comprehension has broad implications, and is a much needed step in the cognitive neuroscience of language processing. The research presented here provides part of an initial foundation for a full understanding of how the two hemispheres coordinate resources during complex cognitive phenomena such as language comprehension.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158305243", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/82197"]}, {"authors": ["Meinema, J.G."], "title": "The implementation of new clinical evidence in clinical practice:Exploring the role of education", "datePublished": "2023-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2023, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376287881.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376287881.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376287881", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736966/cover.jpg", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/the-implementation-of-new-clinical-evidence-in-clinical-practice(635420e9-84a1-4ed6-af73-84961f5b0bd6).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736960/Chapter_5.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736964/Chapter_7.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736950/Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736952/Chapter_1.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736954/Chapter_2.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736956/Chapter_3.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/53736962/Chapter_6.pdf", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/635420e9-84a1-4ed6-af73-84961f5b0bd6"]}, {"authors": ["Gillespie, Bob"], "title": "The Relational Effects of Mindfulness Training: A Phenomenological Study", "description": "Using General Systems Theory (Bertalanffy, 1968) and Phenomenology (Husserl, 1913/1931), this qualitative phenomenological study examined the relational effects of mindfulness training when one partner completed an 8-week, hospital based Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR, Kabat-Zinn, 1990) within the last 6 months. In a sample of 12 couples, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with: a) recent MBSR graduates, b) their intimate partners, and c) both members of the couple together. The recent MBSR graduates were novel meditators who had limited previous mindfulness experience before taking the MBSR training and included 7 female and 6 male MBSR graduates. Ten heterosexual couples and 2 same sex couples participated in the study, and the average relationship length was 14.5 years. Over 95% of the participants were White, and 62.5% had graduate degrees. Before the interviews, all couples completed the Revised Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Busby et al., 1995), which indicated that 6 out of 12 couples were relationally distressed. A modified version of the interpretative phenomenological analysis method (Smith et al., 2009) informed the data analysis. The following major themes emerged for the MBSR graduates: 1) awareness of emotional reactivity; 2) creating space and time; 3) making different choices; and 4) humility and moments of connection. Findings confirmed that self-awareness and emotional regulation are not only major outcomes of mindfulness training, but could also be pathways to relationship growth. The intensity and reactivity of intimate partner relationships can offer both opportunities and challenges for MBSR participants trying to integrate mindfulness into their daily lives. Although intimate partners observed improved emotional balance in the graduates, their descriptions of the benefits of MBSR training were diluted compared to the graduates' descriptions. The intimate partners revealed that behavioral shifts in the graduates were emerging, but were limited in scale--suggesting that individual outcomes of MBSR training do not automatically transfer to relationship outcomes. Developing more mindfulness-enhanced couple interventions that prioritize conjoint participation and emphasize relational outcomes may harness the potential relational benefits of mindfulness practice. Future research should focus on the potential differences between distressed and non-distressed couples and include more diverse samples of couples.Ph.D., Couple and Family Therapy -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201302, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190333012.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190333012.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190333012", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6133", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6133"]}, {"authors": ["LA CHIOMA, ALESSANDRO"], "title": "Shisa7: a novel auxiliary subunit in the social network of AMPA receptors.", "description": "Most excitatory transmission in the brain is mediated by AMPA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) that have a major influence in the shape of synaptic currents.

Indeed, AMPAR density is tightly regulated by basic cellular trafficking mechanisms. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which AMPARs travel to and from synapses is a major challenge in basic neuroscience research and of fundamental importance to understand the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity and memory processes in the brain. Recently, several transmembrane proteins, termed AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits, have been shown to be intrinsic partners of the AMPA receptor complexes, critically influencing their trafficking, gating, and pharmacology.

Depending upon the selectivity and sensitivity requirements of the particular application, a variety of detection schemes for CE are available. A review is presented of optical CE detectors.The utility of CE for assessing the purity and stability of a pharmaceutical peptide, nisin, is investigated. With UV absorbance detection, degradants are not identified and unresolved components go undetected. Mass spectrometric analysis of isolated CE fractions provides molecular mass information that aids in degradant identification and determination of peak purity.A CE method that enhances the ability to attach a fluorescent tag to low concentration peptide samples is developed that involves placing a solid phase material at the capillary inlet. Peptides are fluorescently derivatized on the material, eluted, electrophoretically separated, and detected downstream with laser-induced fluorescence.The optimization of a CE separation method for the analysis of peptide neurotransmitters within cellular extracts and single neurons of a marine inveltebrate, Aplysia californica, is presented. UV absorbance is used to detect underivatized peptides at 10$\\sp{-3}-10\\sp{-5}$ M, while a post-column radionuclide phosphor-imaging detector is used to detect $\\sp{35}$S-methionine radiolabeled peptides down to 10$\\sp{-10}$ M.A CE method utilizing direct UV absorbance detection that quantitates nitrite and nitrate levels within ganglia and individual neurons of the sea-slug, Pleurobranchaea californica, is described. The method correlates well to results obtained using NADPH-diaphorase staining, and can be used to monitor nitric oxide synthase activity and nitric oxide (NO) production in vivo.NO is produced non-enzymatically from the reaction of arginine analogs with various reducing agents as elucidated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). A CE method that quantitatively detects nitrite (an NO oxidation product) is developed that confirms the EPR results.The nitroxyl anion, NO$\\sp{-},$ one of the redox forms of NO, is extremely difficult to detect, due to its instability.

The method may be useful for determining if nitroxyl is the active form of NO in a variety of biochemical reactions.U of I OnlyETDs are only available to UIUC Users without author permissio", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291718379", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/22601"]}, {"authors": ["Silva, Virg\u00edlia S.", "Cordeiro, J.

We observed that sub-acute (daily supply of 1.00 g of AlCl3 during 10 days) and chronic (daily supply of 0.03 g of AlCl3 during 4 months) exposure to dietary aluminum leads to a synaptosomal aluminum enrichment of 45 and 59%, respectively. During chronic exposure to AlCl3, the enhancement of aluminum content was prevented by administration of colestipol (0.31 g/day), which decreased the synaptosomal membrane CH/PL molar ratio (nmol/nmol) from 1.2 to 0.4. Fluorescence anisotropy analysis, using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and 1-(4-(trimethylamino)phenyl)-6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triene (TMA-DPH), showed that after treatment with colestipol a decrease in membrane order occurs at the level of hydrophilic lipid-water surface and deeper hydrophobic region of the synaptosomal membrane. When the rats were exposed to aluminum, it was observed a significant enhancement of membrane fluidity, which was more pronounced at the level of the membrane hydrophilic regions. Meanwhile, when chronic exposure to dietary AlCl3 was accompanied by treatment with colestipol, the aluminum-induced decrease in membrane order was negligible when compared to TMA-DPH and DPH anisotropy values measured upon colestipol treatment. In contrast, in vitro incubation of synaptosomes (isolated from control rats) with AlCl3 induced a concentration-dependent rigidification of this more hydrophilic membrane region. The opposite action of aluminum on synaptosomal membrane fluidity, during in vivo and in vitro experiments, appears to be explained by alteration of synaptosomal CH/PL molar ratio, since a significant reduction (similar to80%) of this parameter occurs during in vivo exposure to aluminum. In conclusion, during in vivo exposure to aluminum, fluidification of hydrophilic regions and reduction of CH/PL molar ratio of presynaptic membranes accompany the accumulation of this cation, which appear to restrict aluminum retention in brain cortex nerve terminals.

In experiments three and four, associated word pairs of varying associative strengths were used to investigate automatic and controlled aspects of semantic processing; the results strongly suggest that both hemispheres were equally capable of accessing associative information and similarly sensitive to associative strength. Contrary to prominent cognitive neuroscience theories of meaning apprehension, this work shows that the hemispheres exhibit broad similarity in semantic representations and breadth of semantic activation. Instead, the present results suggest that the hemispheres differ in when and how they recruit multiple top-down semantic mechanisms to shape that initial activation over time. For instance, the left hemisphere was better able to employ controlled processes to reorder non-canonical meaning relations. In contrast, the right hemisphere needed more explicit task support to recruit such strategic processes. Furthermore, the present results also revealed a left hemisphere benefit for processing predictable information, suggesting that it was better able to use top-down mechanisms to predict and prepare for likely upcoming words. In sum, this thesis provides evidence for multiple, complementary semantic processes recruited in the cerebral hemispheres and outlines how these mechanisms collectively provide robust tools for rapid language comprehension.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158305233", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/82187"]}, {"authors": ["Zhao, Rongkai"], "title": "Digitizing a Three-Dimensional Brain Atlas: Image Sequence Alignment and Volumetric Encoding", "description": "149 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.A 3D brain digital atlas is an important tool for neuroscience research. Many different imaging technologies such as MRI, CT, PET, microscopic imaging, and wet section photography, etc., are available. Among the technologies, cryosectioning followed by wet section photography can yield the highest resolution image of a full brain section. However, the images in the raw image sequence are not aligned with each other and therefore must be spatially registered. This dissertation describes several new methods employed by the atlas construction process. The most important components of the image registration process are the objective function and the optimization strategy. Pairwise image registration is inappropriate due to the lack of consideration of global coherence. A novel objective function called minimum entropy of bad prediction (MEBP) is proposed. MEBP is based on information theory and can be used for multi-modal image registration as well as image sequence alignment (ISA). In ISA, MEBP concurrently take multiple images into consideration and therefore can yield better alignment result. The optimization algorithm is a new hybrid method composed of density-based clustering algorithm, multi-resolution method and simplex method. This new method is less data-specific and more suitable for semi-automatic or automatic image registration. The image post-processing and volume compression are other important components in atlas construction. The commonly existed Swiss-cheese type image defect is treated with wavelet-based method and long range correlation. An octree variant, scalable hyperspace file (SHSF), was developed to encode the volumetric data set. SHSF can facilitate volume accessing so that efficient virtual brain slicer and surface viewer are possible to implement. Since a high-resolution brain digital atlas can occupy hundreds of megabytes to tens of gigabytes storage space, in order to support applications on the atlas, volume compression algorithms are necessary. Three compression algorithms for different purposes are proposed. They include lossless method, near-lossless method and progressive lossy-to-lossless method. The progressive method is the most versatile and generalized coder. The various topics covered in this dissertation are compiled into a coherent whole with the digital brain atlas as the central scene.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158304747", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/81701"]}, {"authors": ["Jakobovits, Antal", "Dervaderics, J\u00e1nos", "Iv\u00e1nyi, J\u00e1nos", "Apor, P\u00e9ter", "Fischer, Tam\u00e1s", "J\u00f3j\u00e1rt, Gy\u00f6rgy"], "title": "Foly\u00f3irat-refer\u00e1tumok = From the literature", "description": "Csecsem\u0151- \u00e9s gyermekgy\u00f3gy\u00e1szat:\n\n\n\n1.

Electrophysiological studies of metaphor have underlined two crucial components of the Event-Related Potentials: the N400 component, a centro-parietal negative deflection at 250-500ms that reflect semantic comprehension and context integration; the P600 component, a positive peak in activity at around 600ms that indexes syntactic framing and sentence revision. While cognitive linguistics accounts have explored the nature of the visual metaphor as a favorable mode of communication, studies in neurolinguistics have never thoroughly investigated the role of multimodality in metaphors. With the development of social communication and advertising, the use of metaphoric pictures has gained more and more interest, as the neuroscientific community still does not know to what extent this use facilitates communication or increases its effectiveness. Therefore, there is the need of a new study that incorporates a tight set of stimuli in a rigorous experimental paradigm. We designed a set of stimuli comprising metaphorical and literal noun pairs in either monomodal (verbal) or multimodal (verbo-pictorial) conditions. A cued memory recall on-line task followed each experimental block to verify the effects on memory of all conditions. ERPs were computed and compared through cluster mass permutation tests. Preliminary results show that, compared to verbal metaphors, verbo-pictorial metaphors elicited an N400 effect that was sustained in time and more broadly distributed. This supports the idea that multimodal metaphors recruit a non-overlapping set of neural sources compared to verbal ones, and they may engage the cognitive system longer. Word-picture pairs were remembered better than word-word pairs, but this advantage was slightly larger for literal than metaphorical pairs, suggesting that the benefits possibly associated with multi-modal metaphors did here not particularly concern memory", "datePublished": "2089-12-09T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2089, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/323317524", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-11272019-130354/"]}, {"authors": ["MAZZONI, FRANCESCA"], "title": "Effects of photoreceptor degeneration on the architecture of retinal ganglion cells: implications for Retinitis Pigmentosa therapy", "description": "Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), a family of inherited diseases leading to progressive photoreceptor death, is one of the major causes of blindness in the world, with no cure yet.\nAlbeit the primary cause of the disease is, typically, a defect in a photoreceptor-specific gene, it has been shown that the degeneration of rods and cones triggers remodeling and secondary death of inner retinal neurons, and particularly of bipolar and horizontal cells. Aim of this project is to test the hypothesis that, as an effect of photoreceptor progressive loss, concomitant changes also occur in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the last neurons of the retinal visual pathway and the only exit of retinal information to higher brain centers.\nWe assessed the retention of morphology, overall architecture and survival rate of RGCs in a mouse model of RP, at various stages of the disease progression. Specifically, we generated a transgenic mouse, the rd10/Thy1-GFP mutant, by crossing GFP-M mice, in which GFP is expressed in a small population of RGCs of various types, and rd10 mice, a recent model of autosomal recessive RP. Rd10 mice carry a missense mutation of the beta-subunit of the rod-specific phosphodiesterase gene, causing a typical rod-cone degeneration with a peak at postnatal day 24 (P24). The expression of GFP in a small number of RGCs in the retina of the mutant allowed the detailed study of the fine structure of these neurons at various ages.\nBy combining immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy and analytic morphometry, we studied RGCs in a total of 50 whole mounted retinas of 3 age groups (3, 7 and 9 months of age, thus past the complete degeneration of photoreceptors). A number of 572 RGCs were identified and grouped according to the classification of Sun et al. (2002a). In particular, 4 parameters were taken into account to identify RGCs: the diameter of the dendritic tree, the diameter of the body, the mean stratification depth within the inner plexiform layer and the typical shape of the dendritic arborization. Five RGCs of the same type, at each time point, were drawn three dimensionally with a computer assisted image analyzer. The neuronal tracings were mathematically evaluated to obtain some parameters highly indicative of dendritic tree complexity and fine architecture: the total dendritic length, the total number of nodes and the dendritic tree area. Eight different types of RGCs were analyzed and drawn (for a total of 164 cells), including type A (the largest), B (the smallest) and C (medium sized), both ON and OFF.\nWe found a remarkable preservation of the structural complexity of all the types of RGCs studied, up to 9 months of age, even in the occurrence of major remodeling among second order neurons. In addition, at 9 months of age, the survival of cells in the GCL appeared comparable to the wt counterpart. Finally, still at 9 months, injections of cholera toxin in the eyes demonstrated the presence of anterograde axonal transport of RGCs to the lateral geniculate nucleus and to the superior colliculus. Yet, at the same age, we detected a decrease of 30% in the density of retinal blood vessels providing nourishment to ganglion cells.\nThe remarkable, long term preservation of RGC fine structure, survival and capability of anterograde axonal transport in the retina of rd10 mutant mice, despite blood vessel impoverishment and second order neurons remodeling and degeneration, opens perspectives to therapy for RP based on ganglion cells preservation. In particular, the strategy of implanting epiretinal prostheses, directly stimulating ganglion cells, to restore vision in RP patients could be applied successfully in those cases in which ganglion cells are still viable, such in the case of the rd10 mutation", "datePublished": "2048-03-13T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2048, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/14695147.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/14695147.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/14695147", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-02062008-152305/"]}, {"authors": ["RIGHI, MARTINA"], "title": "Surface modification of peripheral invasive neural interfaces", "description": "The importance of neuronal disorders and neurological impairment in the eld of neuroscience tremendously increased in the recent past.\nMicromachining technologies were established to fabricate implantable devices able to provide a man-machine interface to the nervous system in patients with degenerative diseases or amputee limbs.\nThe present work focuses on peripheral nervous system (PNS) applications in the form of peripheral invasive neural interfaces.\nEven if recognized as one key component for establishing a functional electrical connection with nerves and muscles, invasive electrodes show electrical instabil-ity due to the foreign body response.\nAim of this work was to investigate dierent strategies elaborated to surface-functionalize implantable polyimide sheets for PNS applications, in particular for neural interfaces based on thin lm technology (tf-LIFEs and TIMEs).\nCross-linkable vinyl groups were introduced on the polyimide surface in order to obtain an increase in surface roughness and to create a substrate endowed with structure-reactivity for thiol-containing amino acids or peptides (able to promote neural migration, growth and dierentiation).\nSamples' surfaces, rstly characterized by means of atomic force microscopy and static contact angle mesurements, were subsequently treated with L-cysteine and Rhodamine-B conjugated cysteine and characterized using ninhydrin col-orimetric analysis, SEM microanalysis and image analysis with Matlab.\nFinally, preliminary in vitro tests were conducted using PC12 cells.\nAll results indicated that surface functionalization was successful", "datePublished": "2052-07-17T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2052, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/14704872", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-06212012-145507/"]}, {"authors": ["PIETRA, GIANLUCA"], "title": "STUDIO DEGLI EFFETTI DELL'ARRICCHIMENTO AMBIENTALE NEL TRATTAMENTO DEI DEFICIT VISIVI, COGNITIVI E DI PLASTICITA SINAPTICA IPPOCAMPALE IN UN MODELLO MURINO DELLA SINDROME DI DOWN.", "description": "Un tema di grande attualit\u00e0 nelle Neuroscienze \u00e8 la patologia indotta dalla presenza, durante lo sviluppo dei circuiti neuronali, di livelli abnormi di inibizione cerebrale (overinihibition). Per overinihibition si intende un eccessivo tono inibitorio dato da un\u2019anomala proliferazione dei terminali inibitori, molto spesso GABAergici, a scapito di quelli eccitatori. Tale processo porta di sovente alla comparsa di sindromi caratterizzate da inabilit\u00e0 intellettuale, che insorge precocemente e poi evolve in deficit funzionali permanenti. \u00c8 oggi ampiamente accettata l\u2019idea secondo la quale alla base di tali fenomeni aberranti vi siano alterazioni della plasticit\u00e0 sinaptica dei circuiti cerebrali presenti nei distretti cerebrali colpiti.\nLa ricerca di strategie volte a ridurre i livelli di inibizione cerebrale riveste, pertanto, grande interesse clinico ai fini dello sviluppo di nuove terapie per il trattamento della inabilit\u00e0 intellettuale dipendente da overinihibition. A questo riguardo, una recente pubblicazione dell'Istituto di Neuroscienze del CNR di Pisa (Sale et al., Nature Neuroscience \u2013 2007) ha messo in evidenza come protocolli di Arricchimento Ambientale (AA) possano essere utilizzati con successo sugli animali da laboratorio per abbassare il tono di inibizione corticale e riaprire finestre di plasticit\u00e0 neurale anche in individui in et\u00e0 adulta. L\u2019AA \u00e8 molto usato per studiare l\u2019influenza dell\u2019esperienza sensoriale sul cervello e sul comportamento. Gli animali \u201carricchiti\u201d sono allevati in gruppi sociali numerosi e in gabbie di grandi dimensioni, dove sono presenti numerosi giochi, tunnel e scale, frequentemente cambiati dallo sperimentatore.\nInoltre, gli animali hanno la possibilit\u00e0 di praticare attivit\u00e0 fisica volontaria grazie alla presenza di ruote di movimento. Pertanto, gli animali arricchiti usufruiscono di aumentate relazioni sociali, di una continua stimolazione multi-sensoriale garantita dal rinnovamento degli oggetti e di alti livelli di attivit\u00e0 fisica. I risultati di Sale e collaboratori mostrano che l\u2019AA induce un completo recupero delle funzioni visive in roditori adulti ambliopi (l\u2019ambliopia \u00e8 una patologia dovuta a forte squilibrio funzionale tra i due occhi) e che tale recupero \u00e8 dovuto a una marcata riduzione dell\u2019inibizione GABAergica. Tali dati aprono l\u2019interessante possibilit\u00e0 che l\u2019AA possa essere impiegato proficuamente nel trattamento di altre patologie neurologiche caratterizzate da un\u2019eccessiva inibizione cerebrale.\nLa presente Tesi di Laurea si pone come obiettivo principale lo studio degli effetti dell'AA su una delle pi\u00f9 note sindromi caratterizzate da inabilit\u00e0 intellettuale che insorge durante lo sviluppo, la Sindrome di Down (SD). La SD ha un'incidenza sulla popolazione di circa 1 ogni 700 nati vivi e costituisce un terzo circa dei casi totali di deficit intellettivo. Chiamata anche trisomia 21, \u00e8 dovuta alla mancata disgiunzione meiotica nelle due cellule figlie della coppia di cromosomi 21. Questo porta ad uno sbilanciamento genetico a carico di circa 250 geni, con un fenotipo caratterizzato da forti anomalie e ritardi a livello di sviluppo sia morfologico sia cognitivo, risultanti in un accentuato ritardo mentale associato ad abbassamento del QI. Inoltre, gli individui con SD presentano una spiccata predisposizione allo sviluppo di crisi epilettiche e demenza di tipo Alzheimer.\nRecentemente, \u00e8 stato creato un modello murino molto utile per lo studio della SD, il topo TS65Dn, che presenta un\u2019estesa trisomia a carico del cromosoma 16, omologo del cromosoma 21 umano. Fenotipicamente, i topi Ts65Dn presentano anomalie di sviluppo morfologico e cognitivo del tutto paragonabili a quelle umane, con ben documentati deficit visivi e, a livello comportamentale, di attenzione, memoria e apprendimento. Numerosi studi hanno dimostrato che i deficit cognitivi del topo Ts65Dn sono dovuti ad una eccessiva inibizione a livello dei circuiti ippocampali.\nPoich\u00e9 l\u2019AA \u00e8 efficace nell\u2019indurre un abbassamento del tono inibitorio del cervello adulto, nella presente Tesi ho investigato la possibilit\u00e0 di usare l\u2019AA come strategia terapeutica per il recupero dei deficit funzionali presenti nei topi Ts65Dn. L\u2019indagine \u00e8 stata condotta su tre livelli: 1) comportamentale: studio delle prestazioni cognitive in compiti di memoria spaziale; 2) elettrofisiologico \u2013 plasticit\u00e0 sinaptica: studio dei livelli di plasticit\u00e0 sinaptica a lungo termine nei circuiti dell\u2019ippocampo, i pi\u00f9 colpiti dai livelli eccessivi di inibizione; 3) elettrofisiologico \u2013 funzioni visive: misura dell\u2019acuit\u00e0 visiva e della dominanza oculare. I risultati hanno evidenziato un deficit marcato della memoria spaziale nei topi TS65Dn, valutato mediante l\u2019impiego del labirinto ad acqua di Morris (Morris water maze). Poich\u00e9 le alterazioni a carico della memoria spaziale riscontrate nei TS65Dn sono correlate con livelli ridotti di plasticit\u00e0 sinaptica ippocampale, abbiamo inoltre studiato il potenziamento a lungo termine (LTP) dei potenziali di campo post-sinaptici eccitatori a livello del giro dentato dell\u2019ippocampo, in risposta a stimoli ad alta frequenza. I topi TS65Dn hanno evidenziato una marcata riduzione dei livelli di LTP in tale area. Infine, mediante registrazioni elettrofisiologiche di potenziali evocati visivi (VEP) dalla corteccia visiva primaria, abbiamo messo in luce una riduzione dell\u2019acuit\u00e0 visiva e un\u2019alterazione della dominanza oculare nei topi TS65Dn rispetto ai fratelli non trisomici (controlli).\nUn protocollo di AA iniziato in et\u00e0 adulta e protratto per un periodo di 6 settimane ha indotto un marcato miglioramento di tutti i parametri studiati. Infatti, i topi Ts65Dn allevati in condizioni di AA hanno mostrato prestazioni nel Morris water maze, livelli ippocampali di LTP e valori di acuit\u00e0 visiva e di dominanza oculare non statisticamente diversi da quelli riscontrati nei controlli euploidi. In conclusione, l'AA si dimostra molto efficace nel trattamento dei deficit dovuti ad over-inhibition. La natura non invasiva del trattamento lo rende applicabile anche all\u2019uomo, aprendo quindi la possibilit\u00e0 di testare nuove strategie di stimolazione ambientale per il recupero dei deficit associati alla Sindrome di Down", "datePublished": "2051-06-13T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2051, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/14701987", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-05302011-105819/"]}, {"authors": ["OLIVIERI, DARIO"], "title": "Stimolazione Ambientale e recupero delle funzioni visive in un modello animale di ambliopia", "description": "L\u2019ambliopia, anche detta \u201cocchio pigro\u201d, \u00e8 la pi\u00f9 comune forma di deficit visivo di un occhio nell\u2019adulto, con un\u2019incidenza del 3% circa nella popolazione mondiale. Nell\u2019uomo, l\u2019ambliopia insorge principalmente in seguito a squilibrio funzionale dei due occhi causato da cataratta congenita, difetti di rifrazione (anisometropia) o disallineamento degli assi visivi (strabismo). Lo squilibro funzionale tra i due occhi induce uno shift di dominanza oculare dei neuroni corticali visivi a favore dell\u2019occhio maggiormente usato e una perdita di acuit\u00e0 visiva nell\u2019occhio sfavorito. Il risultato finale pu\u00f2 essere una disabilit\u00e0 permanente che consiste nella compromissione della visione dei dettagli spaziali, nella perdita della visione binoculare e in deficit di visione stereoscopica. Il recupero di tali funzioni \u00e8 possibile solo se una normale esperienza visiva viene ristabilita in stadi precoci di sviluppo cerebrale. Non esistono, invece, trattamenti capaci di indurre recupero in soggetti ambliopi adulti. Il mancato recupero dagli effetti dell\u2019ambliopia nell\u2019adulto \u00e8 dovuto al declino della plasticit\u00e0 neurale che si verifica durante le fasi tardive di sviluppo delle circuiterie corticali, al termine del cosiddetto periodo critico.\nRecentemente, la visione classica secondo la quale il decorso dei periodi critici avviene in maniera rigidamente programmata e non modificabile sperimentalmente \u00e8 stata messa in discussione da nuovi studi che hanno mostrato come sia possibile riaprire, nella corteccia visiva matura, finestre di plasticit\u00e0 simili a quelle degli stadi giovanili.

Se confrontato con le condizioni definite standard (ambienti di piccole dimensioni, assenza di oggetti particolari, pochi individui per gabbia) l\u2019AA offre agli animali l\u2019opportunit\u00e0 di un\u2019accresciuta attivit\u00e0 motoria ed esplorativa e di una continua esposizione a stimoli sensoriali nuovi. I ricercatori dell\u2019Istituto di Neuroscience del CNR hanno dimostrato che tre settimane di AA inducono un completo recupero dell\u2019acuit\u00e0 visiva e della dominanza oculare in ratti adulti resi ambliopi tramite deprivazione monoculare a lungo termine, cio\u00e8 tramite sutura delle palpebre di un occhio effettuata durante il periodo critico e mantenuta fino al raggiungimento dell'et\u00e0 adulta. Il recupero della plasticit\u00e0 in AA \u00e8 associato a una marcata riduzione dell'inibizione GABAergica e un'aumentata espressione della neurotrofina BDNF nella corteccia visiva.\nLa possibilit\u00e0 di favorire il recupero dall'ambliopia tramite un protocollo non invasivo come l\u2019AA offre interessanti possibilit\u00e0 applicative per l\u2019uomo. L'elaborazione di nuovi protocolli di stimolazione ambientale in soggetti umani ambliopi richiede, in primo luogo, lo studio del contributo relativo dato da ciascuna delle variabili (sensoriali e motorie) presenti in AA agli effetti complessivi di riapertura della plasticit\u00e0. Al momento, non \u00e8 noto quale componente sia pi\u00f9 efficace nel riprodurre l'aumento di plasticit\u00e0 indotto dall'AA nella corteccia visiva adulta. Una tale informazione sarebbe certamente decisiva per l'elaborazione di protocolli di stimolazione applicabili all'uomo. Nel mio lavoro di tesi ho effettuato una dettagliata caratterizzazione degli effetti di recupero delle funzioni visive indotti, in ratti adulti ambliopi, da protocolli di stimolazione ambientale basati sul potenziamento di singole variabili presenti nella condizione di AA: stimolazione visiva passiva (ottenuta mediante allevamento in gabbie standard posizionate al centro di un tamburo meccanico girevole sul quale erano incollati stimoli visivi retro-illuminati); stimolazione visiva attiva (ottenuta mediante allenamento dei ratti in un compito di apprendimento percettivo visivo operante all\u2019interno di una vasca); stimolazione motoria, (ottenuta mediante gabbie standard dotate di una ruota di movimento che stimola l'esercizio fisico volontario). I miei risultati mostrano che l'esposizione di ratti adulti ambliopi a condizioni di aumentati livelli di esercizio fisico volontario, stimolazione visiva passiva o stimolazione visiva attiva inducono un recupero delle funzioni visive (acuit\u00e0 visiva e binocularit\u00e0)", "datePublished": "2050-06-07T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2050, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/14699774", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-05102010-215831/"]}, {"authors": ["Lysen, F.C."], "title": "Brainmedia:One hundred years of performing live brains, 1920\u20132020", "datePublished": "2023-11-28T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2023, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/381801144.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/381801144.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/381801144", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549270/Back_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549272/cover.jpg", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/brainmedia(c4337819-3b08-4b0f-b455-bf52487c791a).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549254/Introduction.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549268/Conclusion.pdf", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/c4337819-3b08-4b0f-b455-bf52487c791a", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549252/Front_matter.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Kouwenhoven, W.M."], "title": "The rise and fall of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons:Molecular programming by transcription factors Engrailed 1, Pitx3, and Nkx2.9 during the development of mesodiencephalic neurons", "datePublished": "2026-12-21T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2026, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/381778384.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/381778384.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/381778384", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/f96e512c-c102-40e7-b7c4-de81b0a9e1e1", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817505/00_Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817509/02.pdf", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/the-rise-and-fall-of-mesodiencephalic-dopaminergic-neurons(f96e512c-c102-40e7-b7c4-de81b0a9e1e1).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817511/03.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6899866/cover.jpg", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817523/09.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Radl, Donna M."], "title": "The Effects of Self-Book\u00a9 Art Therapy on Emotional Distress in Female Cancer Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial", "description": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of the Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy intervention on emotional distress and psychological well-being in female cancer patients. Assessing and treating patients\u2019 unmet emotional needs is a national focus in oncology care today. The intervention provided patients with an opportunity to portray their feelings and identify coping skills artistically through a creative process. Art therapy is based on the theory that the human mind tends to experience intrusive and avoidant stress response symptoms when faced with adverse events, such as a life-threatening illness. Creative expression can help patients reintegrate their sense of self and strengthen personal attributes. To evaluate the intervention, a repeated measures randomized controlled trial design was employed. Sixty consenting women were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the six-session Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy intervention group or the standard care control group. Results suggest that Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy may help decrease emotional distress and enhance spiritual well-being in female cancer patients during active oncology treatment. Positive trends in the data were present, but there were no statistically significant differences between the groups for the two main variables. Small treatment effects were found for Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy on participants\u2019 psychological well-being. However, one subscale measure revealed statistically significant greater improvements in Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy participants\u2019 spiritual wellbeing compared to the standard care control participants. Additionally, 30% of art therapy participants reported post-intervention emotional distress scores that were below the clinical range for emotional distress, compared with only 5% of standard care control participants, suggesting that Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy has clinical significance. Analysis of limited narrative data from exit interviews contributed to positive trends in emotional distress, suggesting that emotional needs were met for the majority of Self-Book\u00a9 art therapy participants.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201503, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190322343.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190322343.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190322343", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6147", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6147"]}, {"authors": ["Leahy, Laura Groblewski"], "title": "The Continuum of Premenstrual Symptom Exacerbation in Women With and Without Psychiatric Comorbidities: A Nurses' Health Study", "description": "Background: It is widely known that menstrual cycle fluctuations can significantly affect a woman's mood, behavior and quality of life over the course of her reproductive years, largely due to reproductive hormonal variations during the course of the menstrual cycle. In fact, women are twice as likely as men to experience a mood disorder. Approximately 85% percent of women experience some form of premenstrual symptom exacerbation (PME) and the majority experience symptoms, which are severe enough to interfere with their daily activities. Little is known, however, about the differences in symptom severity, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women who experience PME with and without psychiatric comorbidities. In addition, little is known about how psychiatric comorbidities affect severity of PME, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception. Methods: This study was conducted using a comparative descriptive design to compare premenstrual symptoms, stress, quality of life, healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception among women experiencing PME and psychiatric comorbidities to women who experience PME without psychiatric comorbidities. Women with PME were recruited from various nursing organizations using secure online surveys. After collection of socio-demographic information, premenstrual symptom severity was measured with the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST), stress with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), quality of life with the Quality of Life Scale (QOLS) and healthy lifestyle and wellness self-perception were assessed using the Healthy Lifestyle Questionnaire (HLQ) & Wellness Self-Perception Scale (WSPS). Data Analysis: The data was cleaned, coded and assessed for outliers and shape of distribution prior to data analysis. Analysis included descriptive statistics to describe key characteristics of the sample, and inferential statistics to test the hypotheses. Results: After controlling for diet, exercise, sleep and caffeine intake, psychiatric comorbidities predicted greater PME symptom severity (\u03b2=0.22; T=2.45; P=0.02), higher perceived stress (\u03b2=0.25; T=2.61; P=0.01), and lower levels of wellness self-perception (\u03b2= -0.30; T= -3.14; P=0.00). Psychiatric comorbidities did not predict quality of life  (\u03b2= -0.13; T= -1.28; P=0.20) or healthy lifestyle (\u03b2= -0.13; T= -1.43; P=0.16). Significance: These findings may inform novel pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions and treatment guidelines to achieve optimal symptom management, reduce stress and improve wellness self-perception among women with PME and psychiatric comorbidities.Dr.N.P., Nursing Practice -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201604, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190331121.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190331121.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190331121", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6723", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6723"]}, {"authors": ["Lysen, F.C."], "title": "Brainmedia:One hundred years of performing live brains, 1920\u20132020", "datePublished": "2023-11-28T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2023, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376896801.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376896801.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376896801", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549270/Back_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549272/cover.jpg", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/brainmedia(c4337819-3b08-4b0f-b455-bf52487c791a).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549254/Introduction.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549268/Conclusion.pdf", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/c4337819-3b08-4b0f-b455-bf52487c791a", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/47549252/Front_matter.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32, \u0e40\u0e08\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e13\u0e31\u0e22", "\u0e13\u0e31\u0e10\u0e10\u0e34\u0e15\u0e32, \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e44\u0e1e", "\u0e19\u0e23\u0e35\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e13\u0e4c, \u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e42\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e25", "\u0e28\u0e23\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0d\u0e32, \u0e08\u0e38\u0e2c\u0e32\u0e23\u0e35"], "title": "A study of traditional Thai complementary therapies, traditional Thai midwifery, and herbal utilization of traditional healers: a case study of traditional healers living in NumPung Dam, Sakon Nakhon Province", "description": "\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e38\u0e14\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e38\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e27\u0e34\u0e08\u0e31\u0e22\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e40\u0e17\u0e04\u0e42\u0e19\u0e42\u0e25\u0e22\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e35 \u0e1b\u0e35\u0e07\u0e1a\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e32\u0e13 255", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e1c\u0e39\u0e49\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e0d\u0e48\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e1c\u0e39\u0e49\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e22\u0e38 \u0e2a\u0e33\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e27\u0e34\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e32\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e28\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c \u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e40\u0e17\u0e04\u0e42\u0e19\u0e42\u0e25\u0e22\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e35", "subjects": ["Research Reports"], "year": 2556, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/70941092.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/70941092.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/70941092", "http://sutir.sut.ac.th:8080/sutir/handle/123456789/4664"]}, {"authors": ["Kandhadai, Padmapriya A."], "title": "Meaning Apprehension in the Cerebral Hemispheres", "description": "143 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2009.The first two experiments examined hemispheric differences in the breadth of semantic activation using ambiguous words that possess multiple incompatible meanings, and failed to show significant hemispheric differences in activating and maintaining multiple incompatible meanings. In experiments three and four, associated word pairs of varying associative strengths were used to investigate automatic and controlled aspects of semantic processing; the results strongly suggest that both hemispheres were equally capable of accessing associative information and similarly sensitive to associative strength. Contrary to prominent cognitive neuroscience theories of meaning apprehension, this work shows that the hemispheres exhibit broad similarity in semantic representations and breadth of semantic activation. Instead, the present results suggest that the hemispheres differ in when and how they recruit multiple top-down semantic mechanisms to shape that initial activation over time. For instance, the left hemisphere was better able to employ controlled processes to reorder non-canonical meaning relations. In contrast, the right hemisphere needed more explicit task support to recruit such strategic processes. Furthermore, the present results also revealed a left hemisphere benefit for processing predictable information, suggesting that it was better able to use top-down mechanisms to predict and prepare for likely upcoming words. In sum, this thesis provides evidence for multiple, complementary semantic processes recruited in the cerebral hemispheres and outlines how these mechanisms collectively provide robust tools for rapid language comprehension.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291773724", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/82187"]}, {"authors": ["Hahn, Sowon"], "title": "Attention to Non-Contiguous Locations of the Visual Field", "description": "112 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1997.Our recent finding (Kramer and Hahn, 1995) challenged the traditionally accepted idea that attention can be directed to only one connected area at a time.

Our results suggested that attention can be allocated to noncontiguous regions of space as long as sudden-onsets do not appear between the attended locations. We hypothesized that subjects could allocate attention over noncontiguous locations of the visual fields, but may not be able to maintain the multiple foci if stimulus-based attention capture by sudden-onsets disrupt previous built attentional foci. The series of current experiments further provided the converging evidence that people could attend to multiple (at least two) noncontiguous locations simultaneously.

Monophyly (i.e. presence of a centralized nervous system in urbilateria) vs polyphyly (i.e. multiple origins by parallel centralization of nervous systems within several lineages) are two historically conflicting scenarios to explain such transitions. However, recent phylogenomic and cladistic analysis suggests that complex brains may have independently evolved at least 9 times within different animal lineages. Indeed, even within the phylum Mollusca cephalization might have occurred at least 5 times. Emerging molecular data further suggest that at the genomic level such transitions might have been achieved by changes in expression of just a few transcriptional factors \u2014 not surprising since such events might happen multiple times over 700 million years of animal evolution. Both cladistic and genomic analyses also imply that neurons themselves evolved more than once. Ancestral polarized secretory cells were likely involved in coordination of ciliated locomotion in early animals, and these cells can be considered as evolutionary precursors of neurons within different lineages. Under this scenario, the origins of neurons can be linked to adaptations to stress/injury factors in the form of integrated regeneration-type cellular response with secretory signaling peptides as early neurotransmitters. To further reconstruct the parallel evolution of nervous systems genomic approaches are essential to probe enigmatic neurons of basal metazoans, selected lophotrochozoans (e.g. phoronids, brachiopods) and deuterostomes", "datePublished": "2032-06-30T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1556/ABiol.63.2012.Suppl.2.1", "publisher": "'Akademiai Kiado Zrt.'", "subjects": ["Article", "PeerReviewed", "info:eu-repo/semantics/article"], "year": 2032, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/148785988", "http://real.mtak.hu/72412/1/abiol.63.2012.suppl.2.1.pdf", "http://real.mtak.hu/72412/"]}, {"authors": ["\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e35  \u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e21\u0e17\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c"], "title": "Cultivation of Spirulina platensis (Gomont) Geitler in organic media", "description": "\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e19\u0e34\u0e1e\u0e19\u0e18\u0e4c (\u0e27\u0e17.\u0e21.

Questo porta ad uno sbilanciamento genetico a carico di circa 250 geni, con un fenotipo caratterizzato da forti anomalie e ritardi di sviluppo sia a livello morfologico sia cognitivo, risultanti in deficit cognitivi accentuati e in un abbassamento del QI. Inoltre, gli individui con sindrome di Down presentano una spiccata predisposizione allo sviluppo di crisi epilettiche e demenza di tipo Alzheimer.\nLo studio neurobiologico della sindrome di Down si avvale di numerosi modelli murini transgenici, trisomici per gruppi differenti di geni mappati sul braccio lungo del cromosoma 21 umano (Hsa 21). Nel topo, i geni omologhi a quelli presenti sul Hsa21 sono distribuiti su tre cromosomi: 10, 16, 17. Il modello pi\u00f9 studiato \u00e8 il topo Ts65Dn, che presenta una parziale trisomia del cromosoma 16 dovuta ad una traslocazione robertsoniana e, fenotipicamente, numerose anomalie morfologiche e cognitive del tutto paragonabili a quelle umane, con ben documentati deficit visivi, di attenzione, memoria e apprendimento. Numerosi studi hanno dimostrato che i deficit cognitivi del topo Ts65Dn sono dovuti ad una eccessiva inibizione GABAergica a livello dei circuiti cerebrali, a sua volta causa di severe compromissioni della plasticit\u00e0 sinaptica a lungo termine.\nDi grande interesse clinico \u00e8 la ricerca di strategie terapeutiche non invasive, idonee all\u2019applicazione sugli individui con sindrome di Down, che siano in grado di ridurre i livelli di inibizione e di promuovere il recupero cognitivo negli individui affetti. Tra i trattamenti pi\u00f9 promettenti, una recente pubblicazione dell'Istituto di Neuroscienze del CNR di Pisa (Sale et al., Nature Neuroscience \u2013 2007) ha messo in evidenza come protocolli di arricchimento ambientale (AA) possano essere utilizzati con successo negli animali da laboratorio per abbassare il tono di inibizione corticale e riaprire finestre di plasticit\u00e0 neurale anche in individui in et\u00e0 adulta. L\u2019AA \u00e8 molto usato per studiare l\u2019influenza dell\u2019esperienza sensoriale sul cervello e sul comportamento. Gli animali \u201carricchiti\u201d sono allevati in gruppi sociali numerosi e in gabbie di grandi dimensioni, dove sono presenti numerosi giochi, tunnel e scale, frequentemente cambiati dallo sperimentatore. Inoltre, gli animali hanno la possibilit\u00e0 di praticare attivit\u00e0 fisica volontaria grazie alla presenza di ruote di movimento. Pertanto, gli animali arricchiti usufruiscono di aumentate relazioni sociali, di una continua stimolazione multi-sensoriale garantita dal rinnovamento degli oggetti e di alti livelli di attivit\u00e0 fisica. I risultati di Sale e collaboratori mostrano che l\u2019AA induce un completo recupero delle funzioni visive in roditori adulti ambliopi (l\u2019ambliopia \u00e8 una patologia dovuta a forte squilibrio funzionale tra i due occhi) e che tale recupero \u00e8 dovuto a una marcata riduzione dell\u2019inibizione GABAergica. Tali dati aprono l\u2019interessante possibilit\u00e0 che l\u2019AA possa essere impiegato proficuamente nel trattamento di altre patologie neurologiche caratterizzate da un\u2019eccessiva inibizione cerebrale, come la sindrome di Down. Inoltre, un campo di studi di grande interesse clinico \u00e8 quello relativo alla ricerca di possibili enviromimetic, farmaci in grado di riprodurre gli effetti benefici indotti dall\u2019AA.\nLa presente Tesi di Laurea si articola in tre sezioni sperimentali principali. Nella prima parte ho investigato la possibilit\u00e0 di alleviare i deficit cognitivi e visivi rilevati nei topi Ts65Dn mediante esposizione degli animali trisomici adulti ad un protocollo di AA della durata di 6 settimane. Nella seconda parte ho investigato gli effetti dell\u2019esposizione ad un protocollo di AA precoce sullo sviluppo del sistema visivo nei topi Ts65Dn. Nella terza ed ultima parte, invece, ho studiato gli effetti del trattamento farmacologico con fluoxetina nei topi Ts65Dn adulti. I risultati della prima parte sperimentale hanno evidenziato un completo recupero dell\u2019acuit\u00e0 visiva e delle capacit\u00e0 di apprendimento spaziale nei topi Ts65Dn arricchiti. I risultati della seconda sezione sperimentale hanno dimostrato che i piccoli Ts65Dn arricchiti ricevono aumentati livelli di stimolazione materna rispetto ai piccoli non arricchiti, con una compensazione del ritardo di apertura degli occhi e di sviluppo dell\u2019acuit\u00e0 visiva rispetto ai soggetti trisomici allevati in condizioni standard. I risultati della terza sezione sperimentale hanno evidenziato un parziale recupero delle capacit\u00e0 di apprendimento spaziale nei topi Ts65Dn adulti sottoposti a trattamento cronico con fluoxetina.\nComplessivamente, i risultati riportati nella presente Tesi di Laurea indicano come l\u2019esposizione a stimoli ambientali arricchiti o il trattamento con inibitori selettivi del reuptake della serotonina possano rappresentare valide strategie per contrastare i processi biochimici responsabili delle disfunzione nervose caratteristiche della sindrome di Down", "datePublished": "2052-10-18T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2052, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/14705559", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-09112012-091526/"]}, {"authors": ["Kouwenhoven, W.M."], "title": "The rise and fall of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons:Molecular programming by transcription factors Engrailed 1, Pitx3, and Nkx2.9 during the development of mesodiencephalic neurons", "datePublished": "2026-12-21T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2026, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376252087.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376252087.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376252087", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/f96e512c-c102-40e7-b7c4-de81b0a9e1e1", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817505/00_Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817509/02.pdf", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/the-rise-and-fall-of-mesodiencephalic-dopaminergic-neurons(f96e512c-c102-40e7-b7c4-de81b0a9e1e1).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817511/03.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6899866/cover.jpg", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817523/09.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Waldock, Kirsty A.M."], "title": "Optimising heat illness prevention strategies for the elderly population", "datePublished": "2029-03-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2029, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/379729754.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/379729754.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/379729754", "https://cris.brighton.ac.uk/ws/files/9895579/KW_thesis_with_final_corrections_for_submission_PDF_clean_version_.pdf", "https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/0eb1fb32-2585-4464-8847-75d205b83a59"]}, {"authors": ["Wever, I."], "title": "Defining mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons:Identifying different levels of transcriptional control", "datePublished": "2024-11-22T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2024, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376264863.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376264863.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376264863", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801150/Chapter_1.pdf", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/defining-mesodiencephalic-dopaminergic-neurons(c4fd4fe1-27ce-46ba-a1f1-1c1fed317fbb).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801164/Addenda.pdf", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/c4fd4fe1-27ce-46ba-a1f1-1c1fed317fbb", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801148/Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/29801168/cover.jpg"]}, {"authors": ["Mas\u00eds Vargas, A."], "title": "Metabolic and physiologic effects of acute exposure to artificial light at night", "datePublished": "2023-02-04T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2023, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376898845.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376898845.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376898845", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580123/Chapter_8.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580115/Chapter_4.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580107/Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580109/Chapter_1.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580127/cover.jpg", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/1569279b-5f52-40fb-80bc-96b266027ded", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580111/Chapter_2.pdf", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/metabolic-and-physiologic-effects-of-acute-exposure-to-artificial-light-at-night(1569279b-5f52-40fb-80bc-96b266027ded).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580125/Appendices.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580113/Chapter_3.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/54580117/Chapter_5.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Yu, Haichuan"], "title": "A Dynamic Spectral Light Modulation Unit with Optical Feedback Control for Optogenetic Stimulation", "description": "With recent advances in optical stimulation delivery to optogenetically modified neurons, individual or groups of neurons can be targeted with incredible spatio-temporal accuracy.

However, excitation of multiple neurons and distinct combinations of neurons within a neuronal circuit with laser optical stimulation has not yet been demonstrated. This work presents an optical feedback control unit that fills this need. The unit synthesizes user input and optical information in a continuous feedback loop to develop a control mask for the laser excitation.

Depending upon the selectivity and sensitivity requirements of the particular application, a variety of detection schemes for CE are available. A review is presented of optical CE detectors.The utility of CE for assessing the purity and stability of a pharmaceutical peptide, nisin, is investigated. With UV absorbance detection, degradants are not identified and unresolved components go undetected. Mass spectrometric analysis of isolated CE fractions provides molecular mass information that aids in degradant identification and determination of peak purity.A CE method that enhances the ability to attach a fluorescent tag to low concentration peptide samples is developed that involves placing a solid phase material at the capillary inlet. Peptides are fluorescently derivatized on the material, eluted, electrophoretically separated, and detected downstream with laser-induced fluorescence.The optimization of a CE separation method for the analysis of peptide neurotransmitters within cellular extracts and single neurons of a marine inveltebrate, Aplysia californica, is presented. UV absorbance is used to detect underivatized peptides at 10$\\sp{-3}-10\\sp{-5}$ M, while a post-column radionuclide phosphor-imaging detector is used to detect $\\sp{35}$S-methionine radiolabeled peptides down to 10$\\sp{-10}$ M.A CE method utilizing direct UV absorbance detection that quantitates nitrite and nitrate levels within ganglia and individual neurons of the sea-slug, Pleurobranchaea californica, is described. The method correlates well to results obtained using NADPH-diaphorase staining, and can be used to monitor nitric oxide synthase activity and nitric oxide (NO) production in vivo.NO is produced non-enzymatically from the reaction of arginine analogs with various reducing agents as elucidated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). A CE method that quantitatively detects nitrite (an NO oxidation product) is developed that confirms the EPR results.The nitroxyl anion, NO$\\sp{-},$ one of the redox forms of NO, is extremely difficult to detect, due to its instability. A CE method that detects nitroxyl as NiNO(CN)$\\sb3\\sp{2-}$ is presented.

Now, we aimed to revisit microiontophoresis and demonstrate that it provides valuable data about the pharmacophysiology of neurons and local neuronal networks, in vivo. Extracellular recordings were performed through the central recording channel of multibarrel carbon-fiber microelectrodes in the CA1 pyramidal layer of the hippocampus of anesthetized rats, while N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was locally administrated by means of microiontophoresis through the surrounding micropipettes of the microelectrode. Various separation procedures were used to distinguish putative pyramidal cells and interneurons. Quality of separation was verified by electrophysiological parameters. After the delivery of NMDA in the vicinity of the examined neurons, firing rate of putative pyramidal cells was increased with a significantly higher grade then that of putative interneurons.

A component of the event-related brain potential, the error-related negativity (ERN), appears to be a manifestation of a process that monitors the accuracy of performance. Current evidence suggests that the component is generated in the anterior cingulate cortex. In choice reaction time tasks, the monitoring process compares a representation of the appropriate (correct) response with a representation of the response actually made. The ERN amplitude reflects the degree of mismatch, i.e. the error signal. In the experiments reported in this thesis, subjects performed a visual search, a memory search and an Eriksen flankers task. The error-related negativity (ERN) was smaller with high search loads, with non-automatized stimulus-response mappings, with extended wakefulness, and with reduced stimulus contrast. These data are consistent with the view that difficulties with target identification compromise the computation of the representation of the appropriate response and the error detection process. Uncertainty about the response that should have been made was also reflected in ratings of performance accuracy. The ERN amplitude was large when subjects believed they were in error. The dependence of performance monitoring on the outcome of stimulus-related processing had implications for the effectiveness of error detection. The data suggest that performance accuracy in conditions of data-limited processing was undetermined, because the representation of the appropriate response was ambiguous. However, errors due to impulsive responding were detected, because continued processing of the stimulus after the response was selected prematurely permitted the representation of the appropriate response to be completely specified. The idea that the ERN is associated with performance monitoring was contrasted with the crosstalk monitoring hypothesis, developed to explain functional blood flow changes in the anterior cingulate cortex. The insensitivity of the ERN to the presence of response competition in the Eriksen flankers task provided little support for the model of crosstalk monitoring. Investigations of supervisory control using the methods of cognitive neuroscience promise to further our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie this critical aspect of human information processing.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/158305341", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/82295"]}, {"authors": ["BARTALUCCI, RICCARDO"], "title": "A new robotic exoskeleton system for upper limb rehabilitation by gaze tracking", "description": "E' stato condotto lo sviluppo, implementazione e sperimentazione di un sistema innovativo per la riabilitazione dell'arto superiore, basato su un robot esoscheletrico guidato mediante tecniche di gaze tracking.\nSono stati ideati, sviluppati e valutati sperimentalmente nuovi algoritmi di controllo per la pianificazione adattiva della traiettoria di un robot esoscheletrico, in grado di fornire all'utente una guida attiva nei compiti di raggiungimento ed afferraggio di oggetti, attraverso la lettura dell'intenzione di movimento del soggetto tramite riconoscimento dello sguardo.\nGli algortimi di guida proposti soddisfano i requisiti di sicurezza ed ergonomia dell'applicazione riabilitativa, e sono strutturati per consentire il loro aggiornamento in funzione delle variazioni rilevate nello spazio di lavoro e nel comportamento dell'utente (es. spostamento di target/ostacoli e/o del punto di vista) attraverso un sistema di telecamere ed un dispositivo di eye-tracking indossabile, che sono stati integrati all'interno del sistema robotico", "datePublished": "2050-12-17T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2050, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/14701116.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/14701116.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/14701116", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-11292010-150606/"]}, {"authors": ["Chilton, Gioia Connell"], "title": "An Arts-Based Study of the Dynamics of Expressing Positive Emotions within the Intersubjective Art Making Process", "description": "This arts-based research study explored the dynamics of expressing positive emotions, within the intersubjective art making process. The study addressed a multifaceted problem involving a gap in knowledge about the process of emotional expression through art making, which is key to therapeutic action in art therapy. The design was arts-based research, as art making was the primary means of inquiry. The philosophy and methodology of arts-based research were employed to explore the emotional aspects of intersubjective experience. Following the traditions of arts based research, the meaning-making capacity of creating art was used to illuminate the process of artistic creation in response to the research questions. The research was conducted following approval by the Drexel University IRB. Five English-speaking adults who were professional art therapists were recruited as key informants. The method of data generation involved an initial two hour Art Interview, followed by reflexive memoing and responsive art-making by the researcher and a subsequent second Art Interview with co-researchers. Methodological credibility procedures consisted of member checking and peer review. The data analysis processes involved: 1) traditional use of qualitative data analysis practices, such as the use of MAXQDA-10 software for coding for themes and 2) arts-based research data analysis methods. The analysis of the interview data, artistic data, artistic responses and a creative synthesis addressed the research question in the form of visual art pieces, poetry, a video, three stories, four themes, and a theoretical model. Overall, the verbal and artistic analysis of the data resulted in thematic categories that represent the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective art therapy relationship. Based upon the findings, the emergence of emotions within the intersubjective context was conceptualized as an iterative process beginning with metaphors of life and nature, the development of trust, revelations of emotion, empathic responses, reflexivity and joint artmaking creating and causing destabilization, deconstruction, reconstruction, and reimagining of perceptions and meanings. An emerging, holistic view of emotions and the transformative capacity of artmaking in a context of relational trust were discussed. Clinical applications included consideration of the therapeutic use of response art and joint artmaking. The limitations of the study were also described, as was methodological criteria for arts-based research. Overall, this expanding discourse helped to identify ways art therapy works. The study achieved its aim by contributing knowledge to our understanding of how emotions emerge, are expressed, and assigned meaning within an art therapy relational context.Ph.D., Creative Arts Therapies -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201403, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190332626.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190332626.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190332626", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6128", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6128"]}, {"authors": ["Gencarelli, Amy"], "title": "Assessing the Role of Sleep, Grief, Anxiety, and Depression in a Miscarriage Population", "description": "Miscarriage occurs at a relatively high rate in women who become pregnant with bereavement, anxiety, and depression as commonly experienced consequences of miscarriage. All of these consequences are connected to sleep disturbance, which to date has been neglected within the field of miscarriage research. Sleep is an important facet of miscarriage to evaluate because it is a modifiable behavior that may be a key component to include in follow-up care. We hypothesized that sleep disturbance would coincide with bereavement, anxiety, and depression not only among women who miscarried, but also among the partners of women who miscarried. It was proposed that sleep disturbance, in general, and insomnia, in specific, would be significantly associated with bereavement, anxiety, and depression. Furthermore, bereavement would account for sleep disturbance while controlling for depression. Eighty-eight women and 67 male partners who have experienced a miscarriage within the last year completed surveys on sleep and mood. Findings showed that both women who miscarried and partners of women who have miscarried experienced elevated sleep disturbance, bereavement, anxiety, and insomnia. Both sleep disturbance and insomnia were found to be associated with anxiety and depression. Women reported significantly more mood and sleep disturbance than partners, with the exception of depression and bereavement. Sleep disturbance was associated with female bereavement levels but not partner levels; insomnia was not related to either female or partner bereavement levels. Bereavement did not significantly predict sleep quality after controlling for depression. Future studies should seek to further clarify the relationships among bereavement and sleep by attempting to provide sleep therapy post miscarriage to see if bereavement is significantly improved against a control group who receives treatment as usual. Using a prospective longitudinal design to follow participants throughout their bereavement process would better assist in understanding for whom, under what context, and during which specific time periods bereavement and sleep are most exacerbated, leading to when treatment may be most helpful.M.S., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201603, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190333351.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190333351.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190333351", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6685", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6685"]}, {"authors": ["Manturuk, Christine L."], "title": "The Lived Experience of Hallucinations in Adults with a Diagnosis of Schizophrenia: A Phenomenological Study", "description": "The purpose of this phenomenological research study was to explore the lived experience of hallucinations in adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The literature review introduces hallucinations as a symptom of schizophrenia and their related treatment. It presents first-hand accounts of schizophrenia and hallucinations and identifies phenomenological research of schizophrenia and hallucinations. It introduces art therapy use in the case of schizophrenia, and art therapy research of schizophrenia with evidence that there is a lack of qualitative studies of hallucinations in schizophrenia that utilize art as a means of data collection. \n\nTwo participants were recruited for this study from an outpatient mental health facility in Philadelphia, PA. One participant was male and one female. Both identified as African American, were between the ages of 18-55, and had experienced hallucinations related to their diagnosis of schizophrenia. Data was collected through a brief demographic survey, three drawing directives, and an open-ended interview. Art directives included \u201cDraw what the experience of hallucinating is like for you\u201d on a blank page, \u201cConsider this figure an outline of you, and draw the experience of hallucinating in relation to the figure,\u201d on a horizontal or vertical sheet with figure template, and \u201cFill the circle with what you would like to\u201d on a page with mandala template. The open-ended interview focused on thoughts and feelings related to the first experience of hallucinations, content, frequency and modality experienced in, disclosure to others, management and treatment, and what it was like to express the experience in drawing. \n\nData was analyzed using phenomenological research methods outlined by Moustakas (1994). The following aspects were prominent in an analysis of interviews and drawings: 1) Confusion, doesn\u2019t make sense and want to figure it out 2) Desire to escape and to isolate away from others 3) Difficulty in communicating about the experience 4) Extra perceptions in addition to perceptions of a shared reality 5) Flexible and ambiguous content 6) Involvement of different senses and/or multiple senses 7) Loss of ability to fully orient to a shared reality 8) Loss of autonomy requiring assistance and care 9) Medication and coping strategies 10) Past experiences effect on quality of hallucinations 11) Rarely talked about because of fear of judgment from others 12) Problem and something wrong/illness/punishment 13) Unpredictability, sometimes leading to paranoia.\n\nThe synthesis of these aspects suggests that time and space can be altered by the intrusion of hallucinations. They affect most senses and exist as extra perceptions in addition to those that others may share. Hallucinations can be disorienting, confusing, distracting, and scary. The content of hallucinations can vary given past experiences. There can be a desire to figure out the content of the experience. There is also a tendency to want to escape from the experience and also isolate and go away from others. \n\nIt is hard for individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia to communicate about their hallucinations given their complex and bizarre nature. Uncertainty about the experience and fear of stigma contribute to the limitation of expression.\n\nSupport from others is crucial for the health of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia who are experiencing hallucinations. It is relieving for individuals to speak about the experience with someone who they can trust. Mental health professionals, peers, family, friends, can help individuals cope with the experience and stay oriented to a shared reality, treat with medication, be empathetic to loss of autonomy, and explore thoughts of wanting to escape including thoughts of dying.M.A., Art Therapy and Counseling -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Thesis", "Text"], "year": 201509, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190324420.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190324420.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190324420", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6477", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6477"]}, {"authors": ["Inskip, Jessica A.", "Ravensbergen, Henrike (Rianne) J.

While these wheelchairs are beneficial in multiple ways, the effects of position changes on blood pressure might exacerbate hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion, particularly in those with spinal cord injury (SCI) who can have injury to autonomic nerves that regulate cardiovascular control. Conversely, cardiovascular benefits may be obtained with lowered seating. Here we investigate the effect of moderate changes in wheelchair position on orthostatic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular reflex control.\nMethods\nNineteen individuals with SCI and ten neurologically-intact controls were tested in supine and seated positions (neutral, lowered, and elevated) in the Elevation\u2122 wheelchair.

Beat-to-beat blood pressure, heart rate and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) were recorded non-invasively.\nResults\nSupine blood pressure and MCAv were reduced in individuals with lesions to autonomic pathways, and declined further with standard seating compared to those with preserved autonomic control. Movement to the elevated position triggered pronounced blood pressure and MCAv falls in those with autonomic lesions, with minimum values significantly reduced compared to the seated and lowered positions. The cumulative duration spent below supine blood pressure was greatest in this group. Lowered seating bolstered blood pressure in those with lesions to autonomic pathways.\nConclusions\nIntegrity of the autonomic nervous system is an important variable that affects cardiovascular responses to orthostatic stress and should be considered when individuals with SCI or autonomic dysfunction are selecting wheelchairs", "datePublished": "2107-06-30T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Article"], "year": 2107, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/250576247.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/250576247.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/250576247", "http://summit.sfu.ca/item/19004"]}, {"authors": ["Xie, Fang"], "title": "Neuropeptidomics Across Metazoan Life", "description": "275 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2009.Every neuron in our brain is bathed in a sea of diverse signaling molecules, including peptides. It is well known that neuropeptides, acting as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and peptide hormones, play pivotal roles in a variety of physiological processes, such as learning and memory, sleeping, pain, and anxiety. To understand how neuropeptides work in the human brain can be extremely challenge; fortunately, most neurochemical pathways are well conserved across metazoa, and thus working with simpler model organisms can provide valuable insights into the fundamental principles in the human brain. Several animal models have been commonly used in neuroscience studies, with each having specific advantages for particular research areas. For example, the sea hare (Aplysia californica) is an excellent model to understand the formation, function and plasticity of neuronal networks, while the honey bee (Apis mellifera) is important for uncovering the mechanisms and evolution of social behavior. As studies in these model organisms are undertaken, knowledge of the complement of neuropeptides used by and released from specific neuronal systems will increase our understanding of how complex suites of neuropeptides modulate neuronal network function to generate such complex behaviors. In this dissertation, several projects are presented with the goal of unraveling the functions of neuropeptides in cell-to-cell communication.Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool to unambiguously characterize the amino acid sequences and post-translational modifications of peptides. Several MS platforms, coupled with liquid chromatography (LC), have been employed to explore the neuropeptidome of the central nervous system in different animal models. Additionally, novel putative neuropeptide genes have been identified based on the MS-derived data via de novo sequencing with the assistance of bioinformatic tools. The concurrent neuropeptidomic studies, as part of genome sequencing consortia for these animals, have significantly aided gene annotation efforts as well as future studies of peptide functions in these models.To elucidate the biological functions of hundreds of peptides can be a daunting task. One way to shorten the candidate list is to perform the relative quantitation of samples under different biological conditions. In particular, stable isotopic labeling, followed by LC-MS analysis, has been used to identify peptide signatures that are involved in different aspects of the honey bee foraging behavior.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291765770", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72260"]}, {"authors": ["Bargiotas, Panagiotis", "Dietmann, Anelia", "Haynes, Alan G", "Kallweit, Ulf", "Garcia Calle, Marta", "Schmidt, Markus", "Mathis, Johannes", "Bassetti, Claudio L"], "title": "The Swiss Narcolepsy Scale (SNS) and its short form (sSNS) for the discrimination of narcolepsy in patients with hypersomnolence: a cohort study based on the Bern Sleep-Wake Database.", "description": "Previous studies reported high sensitivity and specificity of the Swiss Narcolepsy Scale (SNS) for the diagnosis of narcolepsy type 1.

Risperidone (n = 428; 7.3%) and aripiprazole (n = 415; 7.1%) were the most commonly used antipsychotic agents. Neurostimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation, gamma knife surgery, and psychosurgery were used in less than 1% of the sample. There was significant variation in the use and accessibility of exposure and response prevention for OCD.\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nThe variation between countries in treatments used for OCD needs further evaluation. Exposure and response prevention is not used as frequently as guidelines suggest and appears difficult to access in most countries. Updated treatment guidelines are recommended.Author V.

I argue that by having an intention to have specific conscious states or specific experiences in the future, one can exercise top-down causation. My theory is compatible with materialism because I accept that consciousness is constitutively dependent on one's brain/body architecture instantiating consciousness. I accept that at all times your conscious state is instantiated, constituted and determined by your occurrent physical state. However, I argue that an intention, desire or goal must be experienced within phenomenal intentionality. I argue that one's brain/body architecture creates one's phenomenally intentional conscious states, but one must also have phenomenal intentional conscious states in order for their brain/body to react to one's internal conscious states. For a theory of top-down causation this means that you must be able to first phenomenally experience your intention in order to cause the physical occurrences to occur (both in the world and inside your brain/body) that are necessary to instantiate an intended conscious state at a future time. This intention will have to be reified often over an extended period of time because the plasticity of the brain requires\\ud\ntime for permanent physical changes in the brain to take place. By this account, one's physical brain/body architecture determines one's phenomenal intentional conscious states bottom-up, but phenomenal intentional conscious states play the role of the necessary experiences that create the top-down causation over one's brain/body architecture. I believe that to talk about whether it is the releasing of chemicals in the brain that creates an experience of being happy, or if the experience of being happy creates the releasing of chemicals in the brain is a moot point. They are both necessary occurrences. The physical and the phenomenal determine how the body and mind will interact together with one's environment, thus enabling topdown/bottom-up causal loops.\\ud\nThis paper focuses on developing a pragmatic theory on how to exercise degrees of top-down causal influence of one's phenomenal consciousness over one's physical brain/body architecture, i.e. their biology. My thesis of meta-intentionality is the view that you can have an intention to instantiate certain phenomenal intentional states of consciousness, and that this intention can lead to alterations in one's biological determinates of consciousness. To have an intention to carry out an action, or to have an intention to have an experience of a specific phenomenal intentional state, is to require neural correlates to instantiate those actions or experiences. According to my theory, consciousness is constituted by one's occurrent biological state, yet this does not necessitate that consciousness does not have emergent features that are not reducible to physical correlates, or that consciousness cannot have top-down causation over\\ud\none's biology. I argue that even if phenomenal consciousness is determined by one's biology, one necessarily needs to have the phenomenal intentional experience of having an intention for the biological correlates instantiating these phenomenal intentional states to occur. This implies that if you do not have an experience at a phenomenal intentional level of having an intention regarding future conscious experiences, then you cannot have top-down causation. I call this intention a meta-intention since 1) the intention will necessarily need to be experienced phenomenally, 2) must be sustained over an extend period of time since permanent changes in one's brain/body architecture takes time, and 3) because these changes come from a \"meta\", or top-down, manner.\\ud\nIn this paper I will demonstrate that in the literature of philosophy of mind there are terms\\ud\nand concepts that are suggestive of emergence and dualism between consciousness and the biological correlates that instantiate consciousness. In section 1 I will establish how a theory of meta-intentionality fits within a phenomenal Intentionalist research program. In section 2 and 3 I will utilize research from embodied cognition and neuroscience for insights on the channels top-down causation might take to occur. In section 4 I will draw parallels from the research on Zen Buddhism and the brain to a theory of meta-intentionality. Lastly, in section 5, I will show how a theory of meta-intentionality can act as a response to nihilism and the problem of eternal return. I do not intent to offer a knock-down argument against materialism regarding consciousness, but instead aim to offer a theory that focuses on the pragmatic utility of taking the assumption that top-down causal influence is possible", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "publisher": "San Francisco State University", "subjects": ["Thesis"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/48498171", "http://hdl.handle.net/10211.3/139427"]}, {"authors": ["Kouwenhoven, W.M."], "title": "The rise and fall of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons:Molecular programming by transcription factors Engrailed 1, Pitx3, and Nkx2.9 during the development of mesodiencephalic neurons", "datePublished": "2026-12-21T00:00:00", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2026, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376874049.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376874049.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376874049", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/f96e512c-c102-40e7-b7c4-de81b0a9e1e1", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817505/00_Front_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817509/02.pdf", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/the-rise-and-fall-of-mesodiencephalic-dopaminergic-neurons(f96e512c-c102-40e7-b7c4-de81b0a9e1e1).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817511/03.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6899866/cover.jpg", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/6817523/09.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Yu, Haichuan"], "title": "A Dynamic Spectral Light Modulation Unit with Optical Feedback Control for Optogenetic Stimulation", "description": "With recent advances in optical stimulation delivery to optogenetically modified neurons, individual or groups of neurons can be targeted with incredible spatio-temporal accuracy.

Our results suggested that attention can be allocated to noncontiguous regions of space as long as sudden-onsets do not appear between the attended locations. We hypothesized that subjects could allocate attention over noncontiguous locations of the visual fields, but may not be able to maintain the multiple foci if stimulus-based attention capture by sudden-onsets disrupt previous built attentional foci. The series of current experiments further provided the converging evidence that people could attend to multiple (at least two) noncontiguous locations simultaneously.

This disease is genetic\nrelated (chromosome 22) and causes tumor growths in the Schwann cells that\ninsulate electromagnetically axons exiting the internal auditory meatus. When\nthe tumors are removed the auditory nerve is usually cut, leaving no connec-\ntion between the cochlea and the brain. For this reason cochlear implants are\nnot an option, and the only solution to restore the sense of hearing are ABIs.\nMost surgeons prefer the translabyrintine approach for ABI placement, a clear\nview of the ventral region of the cochlear nucleus allows neurosurgeons to put\nin place the stimulating part of the device: an array of electrodes directly ap-\nplied on the surface of the brain stem. This paddle is connected to a radio\nreceiver/stimulator that is implanted in the temporal bone. Sound is recorded\nat the level of the pinna and sent to a speech processor; the latter sends the\nexcitatory signal to the receiver thanks to a transmitter coil. This device elec-trically stimulates the auditory pathways by exciting the rst auditory relay\nstation: the cochlear nucleus.The\norigins of electrical stimulation and neurons signaling behaviour were put in the\nclassic paper by Hodgkin-Huxley.The activity of the axon, its response to\nan extracellular applied potential[3], is caracterised by the well known Rattay's\n\"activating function\"[4] (later analitically improved[5]). In models of electrical\nstimulation the potential applied to the organ is calculated using the quasi-static\napproximation; therefore capacitive, inductive and wave propagation contribu-\ntions in Maxwell's equations could be neglected, thus simplifying the modelling\nof the system under analysis.

Elemento essenziale comune a tali tecniche \u00e8 la respirazione profonda e controllata, dipendente nella maggior parte dei casi dalle vie nasali.\nL\u2019attuale letteratura scientifica sia sul modello animale che sul modello umano ha evidenziato che la stimolazione meccanica indotta dal flusso d\u2019aria sull\u2019epitelio nasale \u00e8 in grado di influenzare i pattern oscillatori del bulbo olfattivo, della corteccia piriforme, e delle aree corticali e sottocorticali ad essi connesse.\nLo scopo di questo lavoro di tesi \u00e8 quello di verificare il ritmo del respiro \u00e8 in grado di sincronizzare la frequenza di scarica dei neuroni della corteccia, in virt\u00f9 di tale pathway neurale. Attraverso l\u2019analisi della relazione tra il respiro e lo stato di coscienza, questo studio offre per la prima volta un contributo psicometrico in riferimento all\u2019influenza che la respirazione nasale induce sulla modulazione dell\u2019attivit\u00e0 neuronale nelle cortecce di ordine superiore.\nNella parte introduttiva di questo lavoro di tesi sono descritti i numerosi contributi forniti dalle Neuroscienze contemporanee, ottenuti grazie allo studio sistematico delle vie olfattive sul modello animale, degli effetti sull\u2019attivit\u00e0 cerebrale della respirazione in generale, e delle tecniche di controllo della respirazione (Occidentale e Orientale), di cui sono riportati i principali effetti a livello del sistema nervoso centrale e del sistema nervoso autonomo.\nLa seconda parte descrive la fase sperimentale: su un campione di 16 soggetti praticanti esperti in pratiche meditative, Yoga e Pranayama sono stati studiati gli effetti riportati a seguito del Sama Vritti Pranayama (Respirazione Quadrata). Questa tecnica prevede l\u2019esecuzione di una respirazione nasale lenta e controllata, in cui le fasi respiratorie (inspirazione, pausa a polmoni pieni, espirazione, pausa a polmoni vuoti) hanno tutte la stessa durata, in questo studio pari a 6 secondi, per una frequenza pari a circa 2.5 respiri al minuto (0.04 Hz). Lo stesso campione sperimentale \u00e8 stato sottoposto ad una condizione di controllo in cui era richiesto loro di eseguire una respirazione controllata seguendo gli stessi tempi del Sama Vritti Pranayama, condotta per\u00f2 esclusivamente attraverso la bocca. Per la valutazione dell\u2019esperienza soggettiva \u00e8 stata somministrata una batteria di test di stato e di test retrospettivi.\nI risultati psicometrici mostrano che la respirazione lenta nasale \u00e8 in grado di provocare uno stato alterato di coscienza, caratterizzato da un\u2019alterata percezione del corpo, un aumento dell\u2019introspezione, delle emozioni positive e un\u2019alterazione dei significati attribuibili generalmente all\u2019esperienza. Tali alterazioni a livello dello stato di coscienza permangono anche nel tempo successivo alla respirazione, simulando uno stato temporaneo simil-dissociativo.\nIn conclusione, questo lavoro di tesi mette in luce che le tecniche di controllo del respiro sono in grado di influenzare lo stato di coscienza e lo stato emotivo, probabilmente in virt\u00f9 dell\u2019influenza che l\u2019ingresso ritmico del flusso d\u2019aria attraverso il naso esercita sulla modulazione della frequenza di scarica dei neuroni della corteccia. Inoltre, la respirazione nasale lenta \u00e8 in grado di generare alterazioni nello stato di coscienza paragonabili ad uno stato simil-dissociativo non patologico. L\u2019evidenza oggettiva di questo dato fornito dall\u2019analisi psicometrica suggerisce il possibile utilizzo di tecniche di respirazione lenta nasale nella popolazione sana, preclinica e clinica.\nResearch on breathing, in the last decades, has gained more interest in the neuroscience field in terms of behavioral and psichological effects induced by Pranayama and by Western matrix breathing techniques as autogenic training or progressive muscle relaxation.\nCurrent scientific literature on animal and human models points out air flow induced mechanical stimulation of the nasal epithelium is capable of influencing oscilatory paterns of the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex including connected cortical and subcortical areas.\nThe purpose of this thesis is to verify that the respiratory rhythm is capable of synchronizing cortex neurons discharge by virtue of this neural pathway. This study offers a psychometric contribution to nasal breathing induced influence on modulation of neuronal activity in higher order cortices, through analysis of the relationship between respiration and state of consciousness, for the first time.\nIntroduction part of this thesis describes numerous contemporary contributions in Neuroscience discovered in sistematic studies of olfactory ways in animal models, respiration effects on general brain activity, and respiration control techniques (Western and Oriental) which show the main effects on the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.\nThe second part describes the experimental phase: the effects reported following an Oriental-derived respiratory technique (Sama Vritti Pranayama or Square Respiration) were studied on a sample of 16 subjects experienced in meditation techniques, Yoga and Pranayama.\nSama Vritti Pranayamainvolves the execution of a slow and controlled nasal breathing, in which the respiratory phases (inhalation, pause with full lungs, exhalation, pause with empty lungs) all have the same duration, equal to 6 seconds, for a frequency equal to about 2.5 breaths per minute (0.04 Hz). The same experimental sample was subjected to a control condition in which they were required to perform a controlled breathing using the same pattern as the Sama Vritti Pranayama technique, but conducted exclusively through the mouth. For the evaluation of the subjective experience, a set of state tests and retrospective tests was administered.\nPsychometric results show that slow nasal breathing is able to provoke an altered state of consciousness, characterized by an altered perception of the body, an increase in introspection, positive emotions and an alteration of meanings generally attributable to experience. Such alterations at the level of state of consciousness also remain in the time following the breathing, simulating a temporary, dissociative-like state.\nFinally, this thesis shows that respiration control techniques are able to entrain the state of consciousness and emotional state, probably by virtue of the influence that the rhythmic entry of the air flow through the nose exercises on cortex neurons discharge modulation. Furthermore, slow nasal breathing is able to generate alterations in thestate of consciousness comparable to a non-pathological simil-dissociative state. Objective evidence of this data provided by psychometric analysis suggests a possible use of slow nasal breathing techniques in healthy, preclinical and clinical population", "datePublished": "2088-04-16T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2088, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/199172193", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-03282018-123018/"]}, {"authors": ["Freiberger, Matthias"], "title": "Scaling up integrated photonic reservoirs towards low-power high-bandwidth computing", "datePublished": "2023-06-23T00:00:00", "publisher": "Universiteit Gent.

It is well known that neuropeptides, acting as neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and peptide hormones, play pivotal roles in a variety of physiological processes, such as learning and memory, sleeping, pain, and anxiety. To understand how neuropeptides work in the human brain can be extremely challenge; fortunately, most neurochemical pathways are well conserved across metazoa, and thus working with simpler model organisms can provide valuable insights into the fundamental principles in the human brain. Several animal models have been commonly used in neuroscience studies, with each having specific advantages for particular research areas. For example, the sea hare (Aplysia californica) is an excellent model to understand the formation, function and plasticity of neuronal networks, while the honey bee (Apis mellifera) is important for uncovering the mechanisms and evolution of social behavior. As studies in these model organisms are undertaken, knowledge of the complement of neuropeptides used by and released from specific neuronal systems will increase our understanding of how complex suites of neuropeptides modulate neuronal network function to generate such complex behaviors. In this dissertation, several projects are presented with the goal of unraveling the functions of neuropeptides in cell-to-cell communication.Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool to unambiguously characterize the amino acid sequences and post-translational modifications of peptides. Several MS platforms, coupled with liquid chromatography (LC), have been employed to explore the neuropeptidome of the central nervous system in different animal models. Additionally, novel putative neuropeptide genes have been identified based on the MS-derived data via de novo sequencing with the assistance of bioinformatic tools. The concurrent neuropeptidomic studies, as part of genome sequencing consortia for these animals, have significantly aided gene annotation efforts as well as future studies of peptide functions in these models.To elucidate the biological functions of hundreds of peptides can be a daunting task. One way to shorten the candidate list is to perform the relative quantitation of samples under different biological conditions. In particular, stable isotopic labeling, followed by LC-MS analysis, has been used to identify peptide signatures that are involved in different aspects of the honey bee foraging behavior.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/29174440", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/72260"]}, {"authors": ["TARABELLA, MICHELE"], "title": "Research and development on musical applications featuring colocated collaborative interactions based on mobile devices and web technologies", "description": "The purpose of this report is to support the internship activity I developed at Ircam/Centre Pompidou.

The idea is to make the possibility of playing music together accessible to people, whether they have musical practice or not. One of the most important aspects of the CoSiMa\u2019s philosophy, in fact, is the democratization of this new media by using an accessible platform (e.g a Wi-Fi connection) based on open standards which allow it to be used, for instance, by a great variety of mobile devices (e.g smartphone, iPod, iPad, iPhone, etc.). Envisaged applications of this type are made for artistic purposes (e.g audiovisual collective performances), videogame (e.g collaborative videogames), entertaining media (e.g interactive fictions); the features of this kind of collective pattern can be extended to further uses such as city public services, marketing communication, health and wellbeing and, generally, aspects of communication design. Most of CoSiMa applications and collaborative performances are designed by keeping in mind the idea of proxemics, a semiotic approach to human\u2019s use of space, formalized by anthropologist Edward T.

We cannot dismiss, in fact, from anthropological and social considerations in collaborative-collective-based projects for artistic and recreational activities. Hall\u2019s ideas about proxemics have been examined by composer and performer Lorenzo Bianchi, collaborating with CoSiMa Project, to elaborate and create original composition and musical execution modalities in terms of gestural control, space positioning of the player and generated sound; therefore, this performative approach considers the collaborative and collective side of the participants.\nFrom a technologic point of view, this multimodal environment requires many components to be developed in terms of hardware and software: a client application installed (or accessed via web page) on a mobile device, a web service providing an open API, a database on server and a data management interface.\nThe software side of this technology is based on SoundWorks, a Javascript framework which allows artists and developer to create collective and collaborative performances where a collocated and distributed group of participants can use their own smartphones to whether generate or use sound for interacting by each others, using touch or movement features.\n\ufffc\ufffc\nDuring my period at Ircam, I had the chance to participate to the infield demonstration of many collaborative and collective application such as: Drops, 88 Fingers and ProXoMix (during the Journe\u0301es d\u2019e\u0301tudes @ ESBA TALM and Les Rencontres du Numerique of ANR).\nAnother experience I had occasion be in contact with, has been related to the Lorenzo Bianchi\u2019s Proxemic Fields (during his Residency at Ircam). This research project aim to design two types of participative installations by using mobile devices whether in social context and in 3D audio systems, such as the Ambisonic.\nOn January 20th, 2017, a first demonstration of the Ambisonic Proxemic Field took place in the Studio 1. For that occasion user surveys were prepared to collect informations about feelings, musical expressivity, social issues and usability from the users. The user survey (created by following the model of structured interviews) has been composed and designed to be used as a pattern interview for every CoSiMa application.\nFurthermore, during my internship activity, I developed a Soundworks application commissioned by Donald Glowinsky from the NEAD (Neuroscience of Emotion and Affective Dynamics Lab) of Geneva University, whose interests are involved in the study of behaviour of human interactions by relating emotional and musical context. The application is called ClickNoise1 and is a web application for mobile device, that allows users interacting between each others by generating a single impulse of a white noise signal or of a sample. The objectives are to analyze rhythmic synchronization and social aspects. Every users can manipulate the sound whether by simply touching the device or by shaking it. Finally, the application provides a database service that gathers data regarding information about the session of the performance and the user's interactions; this feature is good for further data analysis.\nThe entire activity has been supervised by Norbert Schnell researcher, developer and founder of CoSiMa research project and by Benjamin Matuszewski, developer for Wave project; moreover, I had occasion to work for Donald Glowinsky, researcher from Geneva University, and with Lorenzo Bianchi, composer and performer during his residency at Ircam", "datePublished": "2087-04-28T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Pisa University Press'", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2087, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/84367187", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04122017-115332/", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04122017-115332/", "http://etd.adm.unipi.it/theses/available/etd-04122017-115332/"]}, {"authors": ["Lewis, Danielle M."], "title": "Music Therapy as a Treatment for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder", "description": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an increasingly prevalent disorder affecting many children in the world today. The impact of autism on a child and their family is significant. This disorder is life changing and its early detection, diagnosis, and treatment is essential for the growth and development of a child affected by ASD. There are several traditional therapies associated with the treatment of ASD in children that include: speech, occupational, applied behavior analysis therapy. Music therapy is not included in the core list of therapies, but is a viable and effective tool to reinforce the concepts taught in the traditional therapy treatments. The purpose of these therapies, including music therapy, is to improve social behaviors, increase focus and attention, increases communication attempts (vocalizations, verbalizations, gestures, and vocabulary), reduce anxiety, and improve body awareness and coordination. Through my findings during this thesis process I have found that music therapy is a viable and effective treatment for autistic children.M.S., Arts Administration -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201601, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190326445.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190326445.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190326445", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6764", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6764"]}, {"authors": ["Sunderaraman, Preeti"], "title": "Financial capacity and neuropsychological performance in acquired brain injury (ABI)", "description": "Difficulty with financial capacity (i.e., difficulty with efficiently managing one's finances), a common consequence in individuals with moderate to severe brain injury, has been found to affect self-autonomy and limit the individual from fully integrating into the community. Previous studies have found that individuals with brain injury have impaired financial capacity six months post-injury. However, the nature of financial capacity with post-injury periods extending to more than a year has not been studied. Moreover, there is mixed evidence regarding the nature and extent to which different cognitive abilities contribute to financial capacity. Therefore, the current study had three specific aims: (1) To compare the nature of financial capacity in individuals with chronic, moderate to severe acquired brain injury (ABI) with demographically matched controls. (2) To examine the contributions of various cognitive abilities (attention, working memory, executive functions, impulsivity) to financial capacity in the ABI group. (3) To investigate the association between the self-report and informant-report report of financial capacity, in the ABI group. A total of 25 participants with chronic, moderate to severe ABI were recruited from a day-treatment program, and 9 age and education matched-healthy control participants were recruited from the community. All participants were administered a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests to measure cognitive abilities and the Financial Competence Assessment Inventory (FCAI) to assess financial capacity. In addition, 22 informants were interviewed using the Third Party Perspective FCAI. Results indicated that the control group outperformed the ABI group on the overall and the different dimensions of financial capacity. In the ABI group, specific cognitive abilities, including attention, working memory, delayed verbal memory, abstract reasoning and impulsivity contributed to different dimensions of financial capacity. However, no associations were found between ABI- and informant-reports of financial capacity suggesting the confounding presence of a combination of cognitive impairments and biases. These findings shed light on the compromised nature of financial management in ABI individuals years after a brain injury, and underscore the importance of focusing on continued monitoring and rehabilitation of this crucial functional ability.Ph.D., Psychology -- Drexel University, 201", "publisher": "Drexel University", "subjects": ["Text", "Thesis"], "year": 201609, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/190332699.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/190332699.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/190332699", "http://hdl.handle.net/1860/idea:6615", "https://idea.library.drexel.edu/islandora/object/idea%3A6615"]}, {"authors": ["Nam, Yoonkey"], "title": "Engineering Principles to Design and Analyze Patterned Neuronal Cultures Using Multielectrode Arrays", "description": "161 p.Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2005.This dissertation addresses several issues related to the construction of reliable and reproducible patterned neuronal cultures on planar multielectrode arrays (MEAs) for biological experiments. Discussed problems include multichannel recording and stimulation for multi-dimensional data analysis, the effect of electrode geometry on spike detection, the longevity of patterned cultures on MEAs, reliable extracellular spike detection, interference with astroglial cells in terms of neuronal confinement and spike detection. MEAs were used to record evoked responses as well as spontaneous activity of patterned cultures  in vitro. These cultures showed synchronized bursting activity after 2 weeks and time-locked responses in respond to electrical stimulations. Different electrode configurations were tested to study the relation between cell/electrode coupling and spike waveforms. An epoxy terminated organosilane (3-gylcidoxypropyl trimethoxysilane) was used as an easy and reproducible protein linker that can produce a stable long-lasting cell pattern for the study of patterned network in vitro. Metal electrodes of MEAs were chemically modified with organosilane or alkanethiol based self-assembled monolayers to fabricate cell-attractive electrodes. The electrode modification did not degrade the capability of neural recording, but expected cell migration toward electrodes was not observed. The growth of astroglial cells was characterized by measuring the compliance to underlying protein or neuronal patterns. Majority of astroglial cells stayed near neurons, which resulted in a confined growth of both neurons and astroglial cells.

The three experiments presented here examine the idea that some typically-studied language processes are composed of distinct contributions from each hemisphere, but that other processes require input from both hemispheres in order to be successfully engaged. Using event-related brain potentials, these studies explore individual and joint contributions of the two hemispheres over time during the comprehension of normal, plausible sentences. In order to bias processing to one hemisphere, sentence-final words are presented in the contralateral half of the visual field. Hemispheric asymmetries and symmetries are examined across several cognitive processing mechanisms, including those at perceptual, semantic, and later processing stages. Results show that, consistent with prior work, normal semantic processing as indexed by the N400 seems to reflect a combination of the processing biases of the two hemispheres. Rather than being composed of independent hemispheric contributions, some later processing stages of comprehension, dubbed semantic revision, seem to require hemispheric cooperation. Finally, the experiments show that the processing biases are flexible, as different experimental contexts lead to recruitment of the hemispheric biases to differing degrees. Understanding how the hemispheres cooperate over time during language comprehension has broad implications, and is a much needed step in the cognitive neuroscience of language processing. The research presented here provides part of an initial foundation for a full understanding of how the two hemispheres coordinate resources during complex cognitive phenomena such as language comprehension.U of I OnlyRestricted to the U of I community idenfinitely during batch ingest of legacy ETD", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 10000, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291773734", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/82197"]}, {"authors": ["K\u00e9ri, Szabolcs"], "title": "L\u00e1gy l\u00e9lektani \u00e9s szociol\u00f3giai t\u00e9nyez\u0151k egy kem\u00e9ny pszichi\u00e1triai betegs\u00e9g h\u00e1tter\u00e9ben: a szkizofr\u00e9nia rejt\u00e9lye = Soft psychological and sociological factors in a hard psychiatric disorder: The mystery of schizophrenia", "description": "A szkizofr\u00e9nia klasszikus idegfejl\u0151d\u00e9si elm\u00e9lete a genetikai s\u00e9r\u00fcl\u00e9kenys\u00e9gre, a korai k\u00f6rnyezeti hat\u00e1sokra (p\u00e9ld\u00e1ul sz\u00fcl\u00e9szeti komplik\u00e1ci\u00f3k) \u00e9s a pszichoszoci\u00e1lis stressz ezekkel mutatott k\u00f6lcs\u00f6nhat\u00e1s\u00e1ra helyezi a hangs\u00falyt.

Due to the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions commonly encountered in remote sensing, no single satellite sensor can provide fine spatial resolution land surface temperature (LST) products with frequent coverage. This situation greatly limits applications that require LST data with fine spatiotemporal resolution. Here, a deep learning-based spatiotemporal temperature fusion network (STTFN) method for the generation of fine spatiotemporal resolution LST products is proposed. In STTFN, a multiscale fusion convolutional neural network is employed to build the complex nonlinear relationship between input and output LSTs. Thus, unlike other LST spatiotemporal fusion approaches, STTFN is able to form the potentially complicated relationships through the use of training data without manually designed mathematical rules making it is more flexible and intelligent than other methods. In addition, two target fine spatial resolution LST images are predicted and then integrated by a spatiotemporal-consistency (STC)-weighting function to take advantage of STC of LST data. A set of analyses using two real LST data sets obtained from Landsat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) were undertaken to evaluate the ability of STTFN to generate fine spatiotemporal resolution LST products. The results show that, compared with three classic fusion methods [the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), the spatiotemporal integrated temperature fusion model (STITFM), and the two-stream convolutional neural network for spatiotemporal image fusion (StfNet)], the proposed network produced the most accurate outputs [average root mean square error (RMSE)  0.971]", "datePublished": "2021-02-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/TGRS.2020.2999943", "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "subjects": ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "General Earth and Planetary Sciences"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/326507582.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/326507582.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/326507582", "https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/4646018/1/STTFN_FINAL VERSION - simple.doc"]}, {"authors": ["G\u00e1lik, Gy\u00f6rgyi"], "title": "Design for the change before behaviour", "description": "Local governments around the world are spending millions to monitor, analyse and visualise air pollution using smart technologies; however, data and visualisations can only be effective if equally strong actions are taken to improve air quality. This thesis critically analyses the often reductionist technological approaches to, and narratives of, smart cities which are aimed at addressing air pollution and mitigating the effects of climate change, with a focus on two main areas. First, it offers evidence-based practical alternatives to these approaches and suggests how future work in this field might expand this narrow design space. Second, it examines and applies in practice a number of social psychology and behaviour change insights, to understand the most appropriate ways of helping people transition to zero- and low-pollution lifestyles through the design of new technology enablers and through collective action.\n\n\n\nMitigation-focused actions will not be enough to address the complexity and severity of the air pollution challenge alone. This enquiry focuses on using design research practices to develop a set of technology experiments or enablers that could shift the focus from pollution monitoring (measuring pollution that has already been produced) to pollution prevention (pre-empting pollution before it is produced). Current sensing and data visualisation projects in the fields of design for behaviour change, human-computer interaction (HCI) and persuasive technologies often either focus on 1) the behaviour while it is being performed or 2) reporting about the behaviour that has already been performed. The prevention-focused technology design experiments in this PhD set out to understand the moment or space right before a behaviour occurs. Through this enquiry, it is argued that a technology enabler can be designed to address\n\nthis moment or space and intervene to gain time for and enable a deliberate pause between people\u2019s \u2018auto-pilot\u2019 behaviours and more effortful considerations of their day-to-day activities; their usual behaviour can be disrupted and shifted to a new behaviour. But this shift is only possible if 1) the right advice is designed and delivered at 2) the right time with 3) the right frequency, and in 4) the right place and context. Moreover, while it is difficult to identify and address all the reasons for the discrepancy between people\u2019s values and intentions and their actual behaviours or actions, this thesis also argues that technology enablers could help in efforts of closing the \u2018value-action\u2019 gap and deliver feedback to a space where it was previously missing. \n\n\n\nIn alignment with these findings, and because of their widespread use in people\u2019s homes, this thesis tests current home artificial intelligence (AI) assistants and applies them to deliver a set of behavioural and psychological insights in practice. The four design experiments described in this thesis offer new socially and environmentally minded adaptations to these assistants. They shed light on potentially more meaningful types of interactions with these technologies, demonstrating how they could engender a more proactive role for citizens in enabling positive social and environmental change.\n\n\n\nIn the first two experiments, a new skill is applied to an existing AI assistant technology. In the second, the author takes on the role of an AI assistant, to better understand her participants\u2019 view on air pollution, the climate crisis and sustainability in general: what they value and prioritise in their daily lives, social practices and behaviours, and what activities they might be willing to change. In the third experiment, a new design method and custom-built, digital assistant or social companion known as Climate Pal (CP) is developed with a group of participants. This demonstrates the potential role of home assistant technologies to increase the degree of participation in pre-empting pollution in cities and help people articulate their own agency in complex environmental matters. The final experiment offers a new alternative to further increasing people\u2019s agency by connecting them through a network of home assistant\n\ndevices to a group of like-minded people, so they could enable and take collective social and environmental action together. This new approach tests whether the social aspect of the intervention makes participants\u2019 engagement and the changes in their behaviour more durable than if the intervention were to be focused solely on individual action. The outcomes point to the need for new technology designs that account for and support participants\u2019 core values and desire for social connection and belongingness, for being challenged by, and learning from, others; for doing good for other people; working towards a shared goal; and becoming part of something greater than themselves.\n\n\n\nThis PhD sets out to design technologies that increase people\u2019s agency in taking meaningful social and environmental action, individually as well as collectively. The aim of this is to overcome the perception that small changes by individuals are somewhat futile when it comes to the inaction of a whole world of other people.

The main objective of this PhD was to explore and propose novel approaches for addressing the challenges associated with creating personalised models and making predictions in real world health-related applications when training is performed incrementally on scarce sporadic biomedical data. A particular challenge was being able to provide reliable personalised predictions in the early stage of data collection when insufficient data are available for training.The solution proposed in this dissertation is centred on Bayesian Transfer Learning techniques that allowed me to make informed predictions even in such challenging conditions by leveraging information coming from other patients.\n\n\n\nFirstly, I proposed a non-parametric transfer learning approach, which allowed me to make more accurate predictions about a specific patient by combining models trained on other \u201cdonor\u201d patients in proportion to how well these models fit the specific patient\u2019s past observations. Secondly, I developed a parametric transfer learning approach, which incorporated a modified prior that accounts for the knowledge available from all other \u201cdonor\u201d patients. Finally, I proposed modified versions of the previous two approaches, where I controlled how much information is borrowed for transfer based on the similarity in emotional profiles between the patient under test and each \u201cdonor\u201d patient. The results show that the proposed transfer learning methods not only naturally dealt with the uneven, sporadic data in the dataset but also performed very well even in the hardest forecasting scenarios, such as the case where only seven days of data are available, and the system is required to forecast for the next seven days. In general these approaches produced better-suited models for participants with very few sporadic training samples and performed significantly better than a number of competing models", "datePublished": "2021-01-19T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/373373622.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/373373622.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/373373622", "http://repository.essex.ac.uk/29568/1/1606239_Christinaki%20Eirini_PhD%20Thesis.pdf", "http://repository.essex.ac.uk/29568/"]}, {"authors": ["Korko, Malgorzata", "Coulson, Mark", "Jones, Alexander", "De Mornay Davies, Paul"], "title": "Types of interference and their resolution in monolingual word production", "description": "There is growing evidence that speakers recruit inhibitory control in situations of high within-language interference, e.g., when selecting from among competing lexical entries or when tailoring utterances to the communicative needs of the addressee. However, little is known about the types of cognitive control mechanisms that are involved in the speech production process. This study examines the relative contribution of various forms of interference arising at different stages of information processing as well as their control to object naming under conditions of prepotent and underdetermined competition. Eighty-nine unimpaired native English speakers completed three inhibitory control tasks (arrow flanker, Simon arrow and anti-saccade) and two object naming tasks (picture-word interference, PWI, and name agreement, NA). Analyses of mean RT and RT distribution (delta plots) showed that only the flanker effect was a significant predictor of the PWI but not NA effect, while the remaining inhibitory measures made no significant contribution to either the PWI or NA effect. Participants with smaller flanker effects, indicative of better resolution of representational conflict, were faster to name objects in the face of competing stimuli. The pattern of results suggests that delays in production can be an outcome of inefficient resolution of interference traced to intermediate rather than late stages of processing, at least as far as the PWI task is concerned", "datePublished": "2021-03-31T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1016/j.actpsy.2021.103251", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": [], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/373911866.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/373911866.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/373911866", "https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/31869/1/Korko%20et%20al%20%282021%29%20Types%20of%20interference%20nd%20their%20resolution%20in%20monolingual%20word%20production.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Sozen, Berna", "Demir, Necdet", "Zernicka-Goetz, Magdalena"], "title": "BMP signalling is required for extra-embryonic ectoderm development during pre-to-post-implantation transition of the mouse embryo", "description": "At implantation, the mouse embryo undergoes a critical transformation which requires the precise spatiotemporal control of signalling pathways necessary for morphogenesis and developmental progression. The role played by such signalling pathways during this transition are largely unexplored, due to the inaccessibility of the embryo during the implantation when it becomes engulfed by uterine tissues. Genetic studies demonstrate that mutant embryos for BMPs die around gastrulation. Here we have aimed to dissect the role of BMPs during pre-to post-implantation transition by using a protocol permitting the development of the embryo beyond implantation stages in vitro and using stem cells to mimic post-implantation tissue organisation. By assessing both the canonical and non-canonical mechanisms of BMP, we show that the loss of canonical BMP activity compromises the extra-embryonic ectoderm development. Our analyses demonstrate that BMP signalling maintains stem cell populations within both embryonic/extra-embryonic tissues during pre-to post-implantation development.

The way that standard therapy is provided today impacts long-term disability and dependency in ADL insufficiently. The associated need for long-term care and the increase in health-care costs hence demand for novel therapeutic approaches. For this reason, we need to obtain gain a better understanding of the manifold consequences and the recovery process after stroke. In this dissertation we will advance the idea that besides increasing the intensity other factors need to be considered. Rehabilitation must incorporate learning strategies that induce recovery by changing the impaired behaviour. The principles of learning can be obtained from animal and human learning neuroscientific literature. As symptoms are neurologically and behaviourally interrelated, they can be addressed by common learning methods. We argue that technology is an aptly medium to implement and test these methods. Technology-based rehabilitation systems are not only cost-efficient, scalable and accessible, but also allow us to induce virtual manipulations which enhances learning in a way that is not possible in reality. The main goal of this dissertation is to design, test and deliver advanced neuroscience-based therapies in virtual reality that exploit principles of learning. We first offer a synthesis of known principles of learning obtained from human and animal behaviour and show that VR-based systems that incorporate these principles can have a significant impact on recovery. We then explore in three studies how augmented sensorimotor performance, individualized challenges and goal-oriented embodied training in a VR-based rehabilitation system can modify behaviour to address physical, cognitive and social post-stroke consequences. Lastly, we offer two possibilities how the information gained through the VR-based training can help to understand deficits better and therefore complement diagnostics. The contribution of the scientific work presented in this dissertation is that a systematic principle-based approach that augments learning with the advantages of technology can address a variety of post-stroke deficits and advance the understanding of recovery", "datePublished": "2021-09-21T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Universitat Pompeu Fabra'", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis", "info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/350120188", "http://hdl.handle.net/10803/669676"]}, {"authors": ["Messinger, A.", "Sirmpilatze, N.", "Heuer, K.", "Loh, K.", "Mars, R.", "Sein, J.", "Xu, T.", "Glen, D.", "Jung, B.", "Seidlitz, J.", "Taylor, P.", "Toro, R.", "Garza-Villarreal, E.", "Sponheim, C.", "Wang, X.", "Benn, R.", "Cagna, B.", "Dadarwal, R.", "Evrard, H.", "Garcia-Saldivar, P.", "Giavasis, S.", "Hartig, R.", "Lepage, C.", "Liu, C.", "Majka, P.", "Merchant, H.", "Milham, M.", "Rosa, M.", "Tasserie, J.", "Uhrig, L.", "Margulies, D.", "Klink, P."], "title": "A collaborative resource platform for non-human primate neuroimaging", "description": "Neuroimaging non-human primates (NHPs) is a growing, yet highly specialized field of neuroscience.

This system can be further described in terms of its ascending and descending components, or pathways. The ascending pathway starts with the cochlea at the periphery; it processes and then propagates the information about sound towards the auditory cortex. The descending component consists of neural pathways that originate at the top of the central auditory system\u2019s hierarchy and may exert focal and wide-spread influences at various lower levels of the ascending auditory pathway, determining or modifying how the ascending auditory information is processed. This dissertation is focused on understanding of neuroanatomical and functional organization of the corticocollicular system \u2013 one of the largest descending projections within the central auditory system.\nThe first chapter of this work lays out a detailed background about the auditory corticocollicular system. The focus of this chapter is on the mouse brain, however, some information is also drawn from neuroscience research on other mammalian species, when appropriate. In the second chapter, I describe the results of my first neuroanatomical study, which postulate that layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons arise from distinct neocortical regions, with cellular distributions that only partially overlap. This organization suggests that layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons have different functions in terms of modulating auditory processing in the midbrain. In the third chapter, a wide-field in vivo imaging approach is combined with neuroanatomical tracing of the corticocollicular pathway to examine the specificity of origin of layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons in the mouse auditory cortex. A key finding of this chapter shows that layer 6 corticocollicular neurons are likely to be more involved in carrying non-auditory or multisensory information signals to the inferior colliculus. Retrograde and viral anterograde tracing were used in the final study and are described in the fourth chapter. These experiments provided further support for differential roles of layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons in sound processing, and plausible multisensory nature of layer 6 corticocollicular neurons. An important finding from this chapter is the dichotomy of layer 5 and layer 6 synaptic innervation of different target regions within the inferior colliculus.\nTogether, the results of this work add to the foundation upon which the differences between layer 5 and layer 6 corticocollicular neurons can be understood. The new organization principles of the system described in this dissertation are important for understanding the functions of the corticocollicular system, as well as how the limbic, memory and other sensory systems may affect and integrate with early-stage auditory processing.U of I OnlyAuthor requested U of Illinois access only (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "datePublished": "2021-08-23T20:36:18", "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/227472602", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/105052"]}, {"authors": ["Lindsley, Josephine Grant"], "title": "Resistance and Accommodation: A Case Study of Social-Emotional Learning for Adolescent Black Boys Led by Black Men", "description": "This two-part paper considers the relationship of research to practice when developing and implementing school-based social-emotional learning (SEL) programs.\nThe first chapter reviews conventional implementation values for SEL. Since the passage of No Child Left Behind, educators have been tasked with bringing research findings to the classroom (Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), 2015). The emphasis on research-informed instruction has brought teaching into the arena of implementation science, a field typically associated with interventions in health care (Bauer, Damschroder, Hagedorn, Smith, & Kilbourne, 2015; Biesta, 2007). The migration of implementation science concepts to education is evident in federal and state documents where terms like fidelity and response to intervention (RtI) describe teaching and learning (ESSA, 2015; NCLB, 2003; Georgia Department of Education SST Resource Manual, 2011). But for educators adopting SEL interventions\u2014interventions which are value-laden, occur in messy environments, and can be difficult to reliably measure\u2014fidelity may be an ill-equipped guide.\nI propose reciprocity is an alternative to fidelity, based on its congruence with a complex systems framework of learning, and the growing field of improvement science (Bryk, 2016; Jacobson, Kapur, & Reimann, 2016; Lewis, 2015). With the understanding that successful collaborations require structures that maximize the expertise of both researchers and educators, I offer markers (and risks) of reciprocity to stimulate conversation about implementation integrity for SEL.\nThe second chapter is a case study (Stake, 1995) of an unscripted SEL intervention led by two Black men for ten adolescent Black boys. The case offers a naturalistic picture of how resistance and accommodation to stereotypes permeate reasoning about social competence for Black boys and men (Garc\u00eda Coll et al., 2006; Rogers & Way, 2018). There is scant attention in traditional SEL programs to how adults interpret and pass on particular social competencies that grow up around experiences of bias. The intervention presented here offers an example. It was developed to address concerns about sexualized behavior among boys and girls at a middle school, using a Participatory, Culture-Specific Intervention Model (PC-SIM) (Varjas et al., 2006). Following Gilligan and Eddy\u2019s (2017) Listening Guide, I found the men\\u27s talk focused on concern for the boys\u2019 safety. Their talk was characterized by survival-oriented resistance to stereotypes about Black male criminality (Ward, 2018) and an embrace of traditional masculinity, to the detriment of considering alternative ways of relating to girls.

Se emplea una perspectiva diacr\u00f3nica y se parte de la premisa de que el cambio siempre estuvo presente, es decir, que la religi\u00f3n no es est\u00e1tica, sino din\u00e1mica. La cronolog\u00eda de esta investigaci\u00f3n abarca principalmente las \u00e9pocas arcaica, cl\u00e1sica y helen\u00edstica.

Methods: 122 children (42.6% boys; 9.9 \u00b1 0.3 years) from six primary schools in North East England, wore uniaxial accelerometers for eight consecutive days. Subject frequency was assessed by teacher diaries. Multilevel models (children nested within schools) examined significant predictors of MVPA across each school-day segment (lesson one, break, lesson two, lunch, lesson three). Results: Pupils averaged 18.33 \u00b1 8.34 min of in-school MVPA, and 90.2% failed to achieve the in-school 30-min MVPA threshold. Across all school-day segments, MVPA accumulation was typically influenced at the individual level. Lessons one and two\u2014dominated by maths and English\u2014were less active than lesson three. Break and lunch were the most active segments. Conclusion: This study breaks new ground, revealing that MVPA accumulation and subject frequency varies greatly during different academic lessons.

O processamento, por parte do sistema nervoso dos organismos, dos mecanismos subjacentes a integra\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00f3rio-motora (a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o de sinais sensoriais em outputs motores) e um dos processos mais fundamentais e, no entanto, mal compreendidos, em neuroci\u00eancias. Neste estudo, visou-se investigar de que forma o nem\u00e1todo Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) efetua a transforma\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00f3rio-motora num dos seus principais\r\ncircuitos neuronais de processamento de informa\u00e7\u00e3o, fundamental na cria\u00e7\u00e3o de comportamentos provocados pela perce\u00e7\u00e3o de odores.\r\nO conectoma de C. elegans foi minuciosamente estudado e mapeado, o que levou a que este nem\u00e1todo seja considerado um modelo biol\u00f3gico valioso para o estudo de circuitos neuronais e das suas fun\u00e7\u00f5es. C. elegans e um organismo facilmente manipul\u00e1vel geneticamente. Transgenes que codificam indicadores de c\u00e1lcio, como e exemplo GCaMP (genetically encoded calcium indicator), podem ser facilmente expressos em neur\u00f3nios de interesse. GCaMP e uma variante de GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) que sofre mudan\u00e7as conformacionais mediante liga\u00e7\u00e3o a i\u00f5es Ca2+ que fluem para \r\no meio intracelular durante um evento de despolariza\u00e7\u00e3o. Esta mudan\u00e7a conformacional provoca a  emiss\u00e3o de fluoresc\u00eancia verde quando o organismo e iluminado com luz azul num setup de microscopia. A transpar\u00eancia de C. elegans torna indicadores de c\u00e1lcio muito adequados para medi\u00e7\u00e3o\r\nde atividade neuronal neste organismo.\r\nCom o advento de t\u00e9cnicas de microscopia para medi\u00e7\u00e3o de atividade neuronal em C. elegans, foram\r\ndesenvolvidos dispositivos microflu\u00eddicos que permitem manter o organismo imobilizado e sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais controladas. A possibilidade de manter o ambiente exterior do organismo sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es controladas permite o registo da atividade de neur\u00f3nios espec\u00edficos, ou mesmo de todo o sistema nervoso, em resolu\u00e7\u00e3o single-cell, durante ambientes sensoriais constantes ou vari\u00e1veis, permitindo a atribui\u00e7\u00e3o de padr\u00f5es de atividade neuronal ao efeito de inputs sensoriais.\r\nDe forma a quimiotaxar em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a ambientes atrativos, C. elegans executa biased random walks, que consiste num aumento da dura\u00e7\u00e3o de per\u00edodos de movimento dianteiro e uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na sequencia de manobras de reorienta\u00e7\u00e3o.

Os princ\u00edpios subjacentes as transforma\u00e7\u00f5es sens\u00f3rio-motoras que influenciam o comportamento do organismo, de forma a causar um aumento ou diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da frequ\u00eancia de per\u00edodos de revers\u00e3o, s\u00e3o\r\nainda largamente desconhecidos. O interneur\u00f3nio AIY e particularmente interessante para estudar estas quest\u00f5es, uma vez que este interneur\u00f3nio recebe sinapses diretas de m\u00faltiplos neur\u00f3nios sensoriais, e estabelece conex\u00f5es reciprocas com v\u00e1rios neur\u00f3nios, tendo estes fun\u00e7\u00f5es na modula\u00e7\u00e3o\r\nda estrat\u00e9gia de locomo\u00e7\u00e3o. AIY foi previamente considerado como sendo fundamental e suficiente para a modula\u00e7\u00e3o de circuitos neuronais que, probabilisticamente, influenciam as principais estrat\u00e9gias comportamentais de C. elegans. Assim, estudar os mecanismos que est\u00e3o na base da transforma\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00f3rio-motora que ocorre em AIY e da maior import\u00e2ncia. Desta forma, ser\u00e1 poss\u00edvel\r\ncompreender os mecanismos empregados pelo sistema nervoso deste nem\u00e1todo, que codificam a execu\u00e7\u00e3o de comportamentos fundamentais para a sua sobreviv\u00eancia e fitness evolutivo: a habilidade\r\nde quimiotaxar em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a ambientes sensoriais vantajosos.\r\nEm organismos que se movem livremente, o registo da atividade neuronal de c\u00e9lulas singulares com a grava\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea do comportamento do animal, permitiu estabelecer uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre atividade neuronal e a execu\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes estrat\u00e9gias de locomo\u00e7\u00e3o, em m\u00faltiplos neur\u00f3nios. Foi\r\nainda observado, em estudos anteriores, que neur\u00f3nios coativos em organismos imobilizados, est\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m ativos durante o mesmo estado comportamental em animais que se movem livremente.\r\nAssim, a atividade de neur\u00f3nios ativos em animais imobilizados pode ser diretamente relacionada com uma estrat\u00e9gia de locomo\u00e7\u00e3o. Embora o animal n\u00e3o esteja capaz de efetivar o comportamento codificado, um sinal de comando motor e gerado no sistema nervoso do animal. Desta forma, e poss\u00edvel compreender como e que o sistema nervoso do C. elegans combina estados comportamentais com inputs sensoriais, em animais imobilizados.\r\nNeur\u00f3nios sensoriais em C. elegans possuem termina\u00e7\u00f5es nervosas expostas ao meio ambiente envolvente e podem reconhecem uma grande variedade de est\u00edmulos sensoriais. Neur\u00f3nios motores\r\nenervam c\u00e9lulas musculares e s\u00e3o os neur\u00f3nios ultimamente respons\u00e1veis pela gera\u00e7\u00e3o de comportamentos. Interneur\u00f3nios s\u00e3o considerados neur\u00f3nios que carecem de termina\u00e7\u00f5es nervosas\r\nsensoriais ou junc\u00f5es neuromusculares, por isso estabelecendo a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o entre neur\u00f3nios sensoriais e motores ao formarem uma extensa rede de intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre os \u00faltimos e outros interneur\u00f3nios.\r\nNeste estudo, foram usadas t\u00e9cnicas de biologia molecular para expressar o indicador de c\u00e1lcio GCaMP em neur\u00f3nios de interesse: no interneur\u00f3nio AIY; num dos seus principais parceiros pr\u00e9-sin\u00e1pticos \u2013 o neur\u00f3nio sensorial AWC; e no interneur\u00f3nio RIM. AWC e um neur\u00f3nio sensorial envolvido na dete\u00e7\u00e3o de m\u00faltiplos odores, incluindo odor bacteriano. RIM e um interneur\u00f3nio pr\u00e9- motor cujos per\u00edodos de elevada atividade est\u00e3o relacionados com a codifica\u00e7\u00e3o de manobras de revers\u00e3o. Foi utilizada microscopia confocal de disco girat\u00f3rio para registar a atividade dos neur\u00f3nios\r\nacima mencionados, atrav\u00e9s das varia\u00e7\u00f5es intracelulares de c\u00e1lcio das c\u00e9lulas, tanto em animais imobilizados, como em animais livres.\r\nObservou-se que a atividade de AIY e aqui reportada como sendo dominada por um sinal codificante\r\nde estados de comando motor (locomo\u00e7\u00e3o dianteira/manobras de revers\u00e3o), na aus\u00eancia de mecanismos de feedback propriocetivo ativos. Apesar dos circuitos neuronais existentes no sistema nervoso de C. elegans, respons\u00e1veis pela sinaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do estado motor instant\u00e2neo para AIY, n\u00e3o serem\r\ndissecados, aqui e observada uma modula\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade do neur\u00f3nio anterior a mudan\u00e7a de estado\r\nde comando motor. Esta observa\u00e7\u00e3o e interpretada como uma indica\u00e7\u00e3o de que AIY regula a ocorr\u00eancia de manobras de revers\u00e3o. AIY recebe input maioritariamente de neur\u00f3nios sensoriais, sendo, por isso, conhecido como um interneur\u00f3nio prim\u00e1rio. E, por isso, surpreendente encontrar uma regula\u00e7\u00e3o de estados de locomo\u00e7\u00e3o do animal numa fase tao precoce de transforma\u00e7\u00e3o sensoriomotora.\r\nEstas descobertas v\u00e3o de encontro a estudos recentes realizados em organismos com sistemas nervosos mais complexos.\r\nDe seguida, visou-se compreender como e que o sinal dominante que governa a atividade de AIY e combinado com informa\u00e7\u00e3o sensorial. Para isso, desenvolveu-se um paradigma de estimula\u00e7\u00e3o sensorial usando dispositivos microflu\u00eddicos que permitem o fornecimento de odores aos animais.\r\nMediu-se a atividade de AWC e AIY em organismos imobilizados, enquanto se providenciou um estimulo sensorial de odor bacteriano. Devido a limita\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas do setup experimental usado para\r\nestimular o animal, n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel recapitular as respostas estereotipadas que o neur\u00f3nio sensorial\r\nAWC apresenta aquando da estimula\u00e7\u00e3o sensorial, como reportado em literatura previa.\r\nAdicionalmente, n\u00e3o foram encontradas evidencias suficientes para afirmar que a atividade de AIY sofreu influencia do estimulo. Assim, n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel compreender em plenitude de que forma AIY combina informa\u00e7\u00e3o de estados motores com informa\u00e7\u00e3o sensorial. No entanto, encontrou-se evidencia para transforma\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00f3rio-motora, possivelmente atrav\u00e9s de outros circuitos neuronais que n\u00e3o o aqui estudado, que influenciou a modula\u00e7\u00e3o do comportamento animal.\r\nEstudos anteriores mostraram que AIY exibe atividade ao longo do ax\u00f3nio e suas proje\u00e7\u00f5es axonais, n\u00e3o existindo relatos de din\u00e2mica de c\u00e1lcio no n\u00facleo ou corpo celular. N\u00e3o e claro qu\u00e3o frequentemente neur\u00f3nios mostram diferentes padr\u00f5es de din\u00e2mica de c\u00e1lcio no soma ou neurites e,\r\nespecificamente, qu\u00e3o frequentemente esta estrat\u00e9gia e usada por interneur\u00f3nios como forma de integrar informa\u00e7\u00e3o sensorial e motora no mesmo espa\u00e7o celular. N\u00e3o se encontrou evidencia de que esta estrat\u00e9gia e usada por AIY, sugerindo que este neur\u00f3nio usa outras abordagens para combinar sinais de diferentes origens.\r\nFinalmente, a atividade de AWC e AIY for registada em animais livres de movimento, na presen\u00e7a de um gradiente bacteriano, uma fonte de alimento para C. elegans e, por isso, um forte estimulo sensorial. Atividade neuronal em animais restringidos de movimento e animais com a capacidade de se moverem livremente mostra diferen\u00e7as. Deste modo, visou-se compreender como e que a atividade de AIY varia na presen\u00e7a de inputs sensoriais que s\u00f3 um animal livre de locomo\u00e7\u00e3o integra (inputs proprioceptivos). A fraca express\u00e3o de GCaMP que foi poss\u00edvel obter em AIY neste estudo limitou a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e temporal dos dados obtidos, que revelaram ser insuficiente para os objetivos propostos.\r\nDe um modo geral, este estudo e relevante para a comunidade por sugerir um interneur\u00f3nio prim\u00e1rio \r\ncomo sendo capaz de modular a ocorr\u00eancia de estados de comando motor em est\u00e1dios iniciais de integra\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00f3rio-motora. Esta estrat\u00e9gia foi recentemente reportada em sistemas nervosos mais complexos, sugerindo ter relev\u00e2ncia funcional para m\u00faltiplos organismos do reino animal.Survival in fast changing environments requires fine-tuned mechanisms that allow the organisms to rapidly react to sensory cues and adapt their behaviour to respond accordingly. The brain\u2019s computations underlying sensorimotor integration, the transformation of sensory signals into motor outputs, is one of the most fundamental, yet poorly understood, processes in neuroscience. Here, we aim to investigate how the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans achieves sensorimotor transformation, by studying one of its most fundamental neuronal circuits for information processing and odour evoked behaviours. By expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators in neurons of interest, we performed in vivo calcium imaging in immobilised worms, both in an environment deprived of fluctuating sensory stimulation and while delivering an attractive odour to the animals. We reveal the activity of a primary sensory neuron to be dominated by a signal encoding motor command states of the animal, and suggest that this neuron may take part in modulating motor command state transitions in the worm\u2019s brain. Moreover, here, we aimed to study how an attractive cue for the worm affects the coding of behavioural states, and how a single neuron can multiplex both behavioural and sensory information. Finally, we recorded the activity of the same neurons in freely crawling animals as an attempt to understand how sensorimotor transformation varies from immobilised to unrestrained animals. Altogether, this work bears potential relevance to the C. elegans \r\ncommunity by suggesting a primary sensory neuron as being capable of modulating motor commands\r\nstates at early stages of sensorimotor transformation. This strategy has recently been reported in higher-order organisms as well, suggesting that it has functional relevance for organisms across the animal kingdom", "datePublished": "2021-05-29T00:00:00", "subjects": ["masterThesis"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/372702157", "http://hdl.handle.net/10451/45876"]}, {"authors": ["Patel, Pradip", "Bhatt, Atul"], "title": "Growth and impact of scholarly contributions for SP University: A Bibliometric Analysis", "description": "Qualitative analysis of bibliographic datasets becomes advantageous to individuals and institutions since the high weightage of \u2018research\u2019 enunciated in assessment ranking or gradation framework.

Replicating prior work, identifying non-acting athletes revealed the negative compatibility effects: viewing tennis players led to faster responses with a foot than a hand, and vice versa for viewing soccer players. Consistent with the idea that negative compatibility effects result from the absence of a predicted action, these effects were eliminated (or reversed) when the athletes were seen carrying out actions typically associated with them.

Epidemiological studies have established the contribution of self\u2010reported sleep duration, sleep quality and chronotype to health outcomes. Mental health and sleep problems are more common in women and men are more likely to be evening types. Few studies have compared the relative strength of these contributions and few studies have assessed these contributions separately in men and women. Furthermore, sleep and circadian characteristics are typically assessed with a limited number of instruments and a narrow range of variables is considered, leaving the understanding of the relative contribution of different predictors somewhat fractionary. We compared sleep quality, sleep duration and chronotype as predictors for self\u2010reported mental and physical health and psychological characteristics in 410 men and 261 women aged 18 to 30.

A self-reported survey was used to collect data on AST and suicide attempts as well as some variables. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between AST and suicide attempts. A meta-analysis with random effects was undertaken to identify the difference in the association between AST and suicide attempts. Results: Across all the adolescents, the prevalence of AST was 37% and the prevalence of suicide attempts was 11.60%. Adolescents who engaged in AST were less likely to have suicide attempts irrespective of gender. The country-wise analysis indicated a large inconsistency in the association between AST and suicide attempt across the countries. Conclusions: AST would appear to be a protective factor for reducing suicide attempts among adolescents. However, the association between AST and suicide attempts varied greatly across the countries.

Almost the whole world, at some point of time, was placed in lock-down in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus, with resulting psychological and economic sequela. As countries start to ease lock-down measures and reopen industries, ensuring a healthy workplace for employees has become imperative. Thus, this paper presents a mobile app-based intelligent portable healthcare (pHealth) tool, called iWorkSafe, to assist industries in detecting possible suspects for COVID-19 infection among their employees who may need primary care. Developed mainly for low-end Android devices, the iWorkSafe app hosts a fuzzy neural network model that integrates data of employees\u2019 health status from the industry\u2019s database, proximity and contact tracing data from the mobile devices, and user-reported COVID-19 self-test data. Using the built-in Bluetooth low energy sensing technology and K Nearest Neighbor and K-means techniques, the app is capable of tracking users\u2019 proximity and trace contact with other employees. Additionally, it uses a logistic regression model to calculate the COVID-19 self-test score and a Bayesian Decision Tree model for checking real-time health condition from intelligent e-health platform for further clinical attention of the employees. Rolled out in an apparel factory on 12 employees as a test case, the pHealth tool generates an alert to maintain social distancing among employees inside the industry. In addition, the app helps employees to estimate risk with possible COVID-19 infection based on the collected data and found that the score is effective in estimating personal health condition of the app user", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1109/access.2021.3050193", "publisher": "'Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)'", "subjects": [], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/372707700.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/372707700.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/372707700", "http://irep.ntu.ac.uk/id/eprint/42042/1/1399332_Mahmud.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Aussems, Suzanne", "Kita, Sotaro"], "title": "Seeing iconic gesture promotes first- and second-order verb generalization in preschoolers", "description": "This study investigated whether seeing iconic gestures depicting verb referents promotes two types of generalization.

These networks are particularly vulnerable to age-related structural atrophy and an associated loss of executive function, yet existing evidence suggests preserved emotion processing ability in ageing. Using longitudinally acquired data from a battery of cognitive tasks, we defined a metric for the rate of decline of executive function. With this metric, we investigated relationships between changes in executive function and emotion reappraisal ability and brain structure, in 34 older adults, using functional and structural MRI. During task-based fMRI, participants were asked to cognitively reappraise negatively valenced images. We hypothesised one of two associations with decreasing executive function over time: 1) a decreased ability to reappraise reflected in decreased PFC and increased amygdala activation, or 2) a neural compensation mechanism characterised by increased PFC activation but no differential amygdala activation. Structurally, for a decreased reappraisal ability, we predicted a decrease in grey matter in PFC and/or a decrease of white matter integrity in amygdala-PFC pathways. Neither of the two hypotheses relating to brain function were completely supported, with the findings indicating a steeper decline in executive function associated with both increased PFC and increased left amygdala activity when reappraising negative stimuli. In addition, white matter integrity of the uncinate fasciculus, a primary white matter tract connecting the amygdala and ventromedial areas of PFC, was lower in those individuals who demonstrated a greater decrease in executive function.

To this date, however, it has received little philosophical analysis. This is unfortunate, because the general concept of hierarchy ranges over two approaches with distinct empirical commitments, and whose conceptual relations remain unclear. We call the first approach the \u201crepresentational hierarchy\u201d view, which posits that an anatomical hierarchy of feed-forward, feed-back, and lateral connections underlies a signal processing hierarchy of input-output relations. Because the representational hierarchy view holds that unimodal sensory representations are subsequently elaborated into more categorical and rule-based ones, it is committed to an increasing degree of abstraction along the hierarchy. The second view, which we call \u201ctopological hierarchy\", is not committed to different representational functions or degrees of abstraction at different levels. Topological approaches instead posit that the hierarchical level of a part of the brain depends on how central it is to the pattern of connections in the system. Based on the current evidence, we argue that three conceptual relations between the two approaches are possible: topological hierarchies could substantiate the traditional representational hierarchy, conflict with it, or contribute to a plurality of approaches needed to understand the organization of the brain. By articulating each of these possibilities, our analysis attempts to open a conceptual space in which further neuroscientific and philosophical reasoning about neural hierarchy can proceed", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/article"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/337890924", "https://philpapers.org/rec/HAUECO"]}, {"authors": ["Zalesna, Agnes"], "title": "Social Media, Bullying, and Preadolescent Eating Disorders: Psychoeducation and Prevention Model", "description": "The purpose of this theoretical project was to examine the available research surrounding preadolescent eating disorders with particular focus on prevalence and risk factors.

Given the importance of self-disclosure for psychological health, this study assessed the viability of using social robots for eliciting rich disclosures that identify needs and emotional states in human interaction partners. Three within-subject experiments were conducted with participants interacting with another person, a humanoid social robot, and a disembodied conversational agent (voice assistant). We performed a number of objective evaluations of disclosures to these three agents via speech content and voice analyses and also probed participants\u2019 subjective evaluations of their disclosures to three agents. Our findings suggest that participants overall disclose more to humans than artificial agents, that agents\u2019 embodiment influences disclosure quantity and quality, and that people are generally aware of differences in their personal disclosures to three agents studied here.

However, little is known about this relationship, while accounting for co-occurring mental health conditions (e.g. anxiety) that are also associated with ANS dysfunction. In addition, research on the ANS has typically involved physiological measurements, without using more clinically meaningful measures of ANS dysfunction, such as the self-reported frequency of ANS-related physical health symptoms. Furthermore, very little is known about ANS function in autistic adults, given that previous research has focused on ANS dysfunction in children with ASD. Addressing these gaps in the literature, we compared ANS function in adults with(out) ASD (Study 1). Although autistic adults reported greater ANS dysfunction than matched neurotypical controls, this difference was not significant after controlling for anxiety and depression. Similarly, in a large nonclinical sample (Study 2), we found that anxiety and stress mediated the relationship between autistic traits and ANS dysfunction. Together, we conclude that ANS dysfunction is not a feature of ASD per se, but instead attributable to the high levels of anxiety and stress in autistic adults.

However, to resolve and characterise white matter (WM) fibres in heterogeneous MRI voxels remains a challenging problem typically approached with signal models that rely on prior information and constraints. We have recently introduced a 5D relaxation\u2013diffusion correlation framework wherein multidimensional diffusion encoding strategies are used to acquire data at multiple echo\u2010times to increase the amount of information encoded into the signal and ease the constraints needed for signal inversion. Nonparametric Monte Carlo inversion of the resulting datasets yields 5D relaxation\u2013diffusion distributions where contributions from different sub\u2010voxel tissue environments are separated with minimal assumptions on their microscopic properties. Here, we build on the 5D correlation approach to derive fibre\u2010specific metrics that can be mapped throughout the imaged brain volume. Distribution components ascribed to fibrous tissues are resolved, and subsequently mapped to a dense mesh of overlapping orientation bins to define a smooth orientation distribution function (ODF). Moreover, relaxation and diffusion measures are correlated to each independent ODF coordinate, thereby allowing the estimation of orientation\u2010specific relaxation rates and diffusivities. The proposed method is tested on a healthy volunteer, where the estimated ODFs were observed to capture major WM tracts, resolve fibre crossings, and, more importantly, inform on the relaxation and diffusion features along with distinct fibre bundles. If combined with fibre\u2010tracking algorithms, the methodology presented in this work has potential for increasing the depth of characterisation of microstructural properties along individual WM pathways", "datePublished": "2021-02-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1002/hbm.25224", "publisher": "'Wiley'", "subjects": [], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/337622893.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/337622893.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/337622893", "http://orca.cf.ac.uk/135674/1/hbm.25224.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Song, Ran", "Liu, Yonghuai", "Rosin, Paul"], "title": "Mesh saliency via weakly supervised classification-for-saliency CNN", "description": "Recently, effort has been made to apply deep learning to the detection of mesh saliency.

Quite a few pilot studies showed that this task is quite difficult. In this work, we solve this problem by developing a novel network trained in a weakly supervised manner. The training is end-to-end and does not require any saliency ground truth but only the class membership of meshes. Our Classification-for-Saliency CNN (CfS-CNN) employs a multi-view setup and contains a newly designed two-channel structure which integrates view-based features of both classification and saliency. It essentially transfers knowledge from 3D object classification to mesh saliency.

The guidance and stability afforded by mentoring relationships can be particularly beneficial to individuals undergoing transitions in their personal or professional lives, or both, and are thus well-suited to play a meaningful role in the lives of emerging adults. Emerging adults are also in a unique developmental stage in which they experience increased freedom and opportunity for exploration away from parents and guardians. While this freedom often results in increased risky behavior, it also allows for exploration and evaluation of moral systems and religious beliefs- a process that is at times accomplished alongside a mentor. However, existing mentoring research is largely directed towards three types of mentoring relationships (adolescent, academic, and vocational) and the spiritual mentoring of emerging adults is infrequently addressed. It is even more rare to find research on the influence of spiritual mentors and the ways mentors may be impacted by spiritual mentoring.\nGuided by the broader mentoring literature and Bandura\u2019s Social Cognitive Theory, the current quantitative study aims to better understand spiritual mentoring relationships and their reciprocal influence on mentors and mentees through the actor-partner interdependence model. The study was conducted using data gleaned from 189 spiritual mentoring pairs. Respondents were obtained through convenience and snowball sampling methods that consistent of contacting colleges, campus organizations, and college ministries across the country that help facilitate spiritual mentoring relationships.\nOverall, numerous factors from both mentee and mentors\u2019 perspectives that were associated with higher levels of mentee relationship quality, instrumental support, psychosocial support, and mentor relationship quality are detailed. Additionally, a preliminary investigation of the impact of mentee perceptions of psychosocial support, instrumental support, and mentor and mentee relationship quality on mentor and mentee outcomes revealed potential improvements in spirituality, intrinsic religiosity, religious commitment, spiritual modeling self-efficacy, and forms of well-being.\nConsistencies with, and deviations from, findings in the larger mentoring literature are discussed and examined in light of the distinctiveness of spiritual mentoring relationships.\nThis study serves as an initial and unique investigation into the dyadic nature of spiritual mentoring relationships and highlights numerous factors that may enhance relationship quality, instrumental support, and psychosocial support. Although much of the mentoring literature emphasizes mentee perspectives and outcomes, this study corroborates existing evidence that both mentees and mentors stand to benefit in meaningful ways from engaging in spiritual mentoring relationships. The necessity of considering both mentee and mentor perspectives is also underscored by the numerous partner effects uncovered in the current work, and the reciprocal dynamics likely underlying the relationships that were explored. Theoretically relevant, but less-studied factors like mentee and mentor perceptions of the other\u2019s motivation and credibility-enhancing displays were demonstrated to be important considerations in spiritual mentoring relationship research. Additional implications of these findings include improved insight for spiritual mentees and mentors, preliminary evidence of the impact of spiritual mentoring relationships, and potential guidance and direction for facilitators of spiritual mentoring relationships", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T08:00:00", "publisher": "UKnowledge", "subjects": ["text"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/373011992.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/373011992.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/373011992", "https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&amp;context=hes_etds", "https://uknowledge.uky.edu/hes_etds/87"]}, {"authors": ["Li, Wenyang", "Coskun, Elif Pinar", "Berger, Rolando", "Slevin, John T.", "Pettigrew, L.

To explore how cortical neuronal activity underpins sequence discrimination, we developed a task in which mice distinguished between tactile \u201cword\u201d sequences constructed from distinct vibrations delivered to the whiskers, assembled in different orders. Animals licked to report the presence of the target sequence. Mice could respond to the earliest possible cues allowing discrimination, effectively solving the task as a \u201cdetection of change\u201d problem, but enhanced their performance when responding later. Optogenetic inactivation showed that the somatosensory cortex was necessary for sequence discrimination. Two-photon imaging in layer 2/3 of the primary somatosensory \u201cbarrel\u201d cortex (S1bf) revealed that, in well-trained animals, neurons had heterogeneous selectivity to multiple task variables including not just sensory input but also the animal\u2019s action decision and the trial outcome (presence or absence of the predicted reward). Many neurons were activated preceding goal-directed licking, thus reflecting the animal\u2019s learned action in response to the target sequence; these neurons were found as soon as mice learned to associate the rewarded sequence with licking. In contrast, learning evoked smaller changes in sensory response tuning: neurons responding to stimulus features were found in naive mice, and training did not generate neurons with enhanced temporal integration or categorical responses. Therefore, in S1bf, sequence learning results in neurons whose activity reflects the learned association between target sequence and licking rather than a refined representation of sensory features", "datePublished": "2021-02-08T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1016/j.cub.2020.10.059", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": [], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/343121442.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/343121442.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/343121442", "http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/95104/1/mmc2-1.pdf"]}, {"authors": ["Bonnar, Orla"], "title": "The effect of ApoE4 on neurovascular coupling in the visual cortex", "description": "Neurovascular coupling (NVC) is the process whereby the brain increases local blood supply in response to neuronal activity, providing neurons with energy.

The main genetic risk factor for developing AD, expression of Apolipoprotein \u03b54 (APOE4), is associated with vascular deficits, including pericyte damage and impaired cerebral blood ow. I tested whether expression of APOE4 affected NVC, by studying neuronal activity and vascular responses in visual cortex.  \n\n\n\nTo investigate this, mice with humanised APOE4 or APOE3 were crossed with mice  expressing a genetically-encoded calcium indicator or with labelled pericytes. Mice were  implanted with a cranial window over visual cortex and neuronal and vascular activity  was recorded using two-photon microscopy. Baseline and stimulus evoked measurements were taken to determine the effect of ApoE4 on basal energy balance and on the ability of the brain to deliver adequate energy to neurons.  \n\n\n\nResults suggest that there were some baseline alterations in APOE4 mice that may result in a lower energy supply. Compounding this, I found there to be a mismatch in energy supply and demand during sensory stimulation, where neuronal demand was greater, but blood supply was less reliable in APOE4 mice.  \n\n\n\nTogether these data suggest that there could be an energy deficit in APOE4 carriers. In vivo studies investigating the role of ApoE4 in NVC are few and the study of individual vessels and neurons across different age points, as done in this body of work, is a novel and unique approach.

Further, such a mechanism also takes into consideration the complexity of the expert, favoring simpler over more cognitively complex experts.

Yet CAPD also lacks clear and consistent diagnostic criteria, with widespread clinical disagreement on this matter. As such, identification of biological markers for CAPD would be useful. A recent genome association study identified a potential CAPD risk gene, USH2A. In a homozygous state, this gene is associated with Usher syndrome type 2 (USH2), a recessive disorder resulting in bilateral, high-frequency hearing loss due to atypical cochlear hair cell development. However, children with heterozygous USH2A mutations have also been found to show unexpected low-frequency hearing loss and reduced early vocabulary, contradicting assumptions that the heterozygous (carrier) state is \u201cphenotype free\u201d. Parallel evidence has confirmed that heterozygous Ush2a mutations in a transgenic mouse model also cause low-frequency hearing loss (Perrino et al., 2020). Importantly, these auditory processing anomalies were still evident after covariance for hearing loss, suggesting a CAPD profile. Since usherin anomalies occur in the peripheral cochlea and not central auditory structures, these findings point to upstream developmental feedback effects of peripheral sensory loss on high-level processing characteristic of CAPD. In this study, we aimed to expand upon the mouse behavioral battery used in Perrino et al. (2020) by evaluating central auditory brain structures, including the superior olivary complex (SOC) and medial geniculate nucleus (MGN), in heterozygous and homozygous Ush2a mice. We found that heterozygous Ush2a mice had significantly larger SOC volumes while homozygous Ush2a had significantly smaller SOC volumes. Heterozygous mutations did not affect the MGN; however, homozygous Ush2a mutations resulted in a significant shift towards more smaller neurons. These findings suggest that alterations in cochlear development due to USH2A variation can secondarily impact the development of brain regions important for auditory processing ability", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["journal article"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/374289762.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/374289762.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/374289762", "https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/file/1f1277ba-cedf-417d-b7e4-4360a04675bc/1/genes-12-00151.pdf", "https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/items/1f1277ba-cedf-417d-b7e4-4360a04675bc/1/"]}, {"authors": ["Boddy, Sarah L", "Giovannelli, Ilaria", "Sassani, Matilde", "Cooper-Knock, Johnathan", "Snyder, Michael P", "Segal, Eran", "Elinav, Eran", "Barker, Lynne", "Shaw, Pamela J", "McDermott, Christopher J"], "title": "The gut microbiome: a key player in the complexity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)", "description": "Background \n\nMuch progress has been made in mapping genetic abnormalities linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the majority of cases still present with no known underlying cause. Furthermore, even in families with a shared genetic abnormality there is significant phenotypic variability, suggesting that non-genetic elements may modify pathogenesis. Identification of such disease-modifiers is important as they might represent new therapeutic targets. A growing body of research has begun to shed light on the role played by the gut microbiome in health and disease with a number of studies linking abnormalities to ALS.\n\nMain body \n\nThe microbiome refers to the genes belonging to the myriad different microorganisms that live within and upon us, collectively known as the microbiota. Most of these microbes are found in the intestines, where they play important roles in digestion and the generation of key metabolites including neurotransmitters. The gut microbiota is an important aspect of the environment in which our bodies operate and inter-individual differences may be key to explaining the different disease outcomes seen in ALS. Work has begun to investigate animal models of the disease, and the gut microbiomes of people living with ALS, revealing changes in the microbial communities of these groups. The current body of knowledge will be summarised in this review. Advances in microbiome sequencing methods will be highlighted, as their improved resolution now enables researchers to further explore differences at a functional level. Proposed mechanisms connecting the gut microbiome to neurodegeneration will also be considered, including direct effects via metabolites released into the host circulation and indirect effects on bioavailability of nutrients and even medications.\n\nConclusion\n\nProfiling of the gut microbiome has the potential to add an environmental component to rapidly advancing studies of ALS genetics and move research a step further towards personalised medicine for this disease. Moreover, should compelling evidence of upstream neurotoxicity or neuroprotection initiated by gut microbiota emerge, modification of the microbiome will represent a potential new avenue for disease modifying therapies.

Evidence for allocentric information guiding ongoing actions stems from studies in which people reached to where targets had previously been seen while other objects were moved. Since egocentric position judgments might fade or change when the target is removed, we sought for conditions in which people might benefit from relying on allocentric information when the target remains visible. We used a task that required participants to intercept targets that moved across a screen using a cursor that represented their finger but that moved by a different amount in a different plane. During each attempt, we perturbed the target, cursor, or background individually or all three simultaneously such that their relative positions did not change and there was no need to adjust the ongoing movement. An obvious way to avoid responding to such simultaneous perturbations is by relying on allocentric information. Relying on egocentric information would give a response that resembles the combined responses to the three isolated perturbations. The hand responded in accordance with the responses to the isolated perturbations despite the differences between how the finger and cursor moved.

Deficits in these processes, related to social cognition and emotion regulation, are oftentimes a hallmark of psychopathological conditions. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the neurobehavioral mechanisms associated with these socioemotional processes would provide unique insights into the factors that may render individuals susceptible to or resilient against socioemotional distress. Despite significant advances in cognitive neuroscience, however, a comprehensive approach to investigate the mechanisms of socioemotional functioning is still scarce. Therefore, there is a need to capitalize on a broad set of approaches for the examination of socioemotional factors at multiple levels (i.e., brain function, behavior, and individual differences), in order to better understand the interplay of emotion and cognition with increased ecological validity. These issues were investigated using a multi-method approach involving functional brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography) in conjunction with behavioral tasks (social evaluation, emotion regulation, episodic memory), and measures of individual differences. Such an approach is essential to elucidate the mechanisms of socioemotional functioning, which may inform the development of novel theoretical frameworks that will lead to the design of assessment tools and interventions that promote social and emotional well-being.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291797741", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/105196"]}, {"authors": ["Operskalski, Joachim Thomas"], "title": "The neural systems supporting human intelligence, as measured by lesion analysis, task activation, and resting state connectivity", "description": "The set structure of human cognitive abilities and their organization in the brain remains as controversial today as it was when the positive manifold between diverse cognitive tests was first explained as being driven by a single capacity for processing information. Alternative explanatory accounts of human intelligence can interpret the same experimental data in support of their competing claims because they do not make testable predictions. Far from being the reductive caricature of itself that some have parodied, cognitive neuroscience is one subfield of psychology (among others) whose methods lend themselves to the generation of testable predictions about how brain structure and function should relate to psychological test performance if different explanatory frameworks were true. This dissertation will explain three experiments on mapping tests of intelligence in the brain: first, a test of analogical reasoning using task-related functional MRI, followed by a test of emotional intelligence using analysis of focal penetrating brain lesions, followed by a test of visuospatial matrix reasoning, or fluid intelligence, using resting state functional MRI.

However, the contribution of ISK to atrial APs under physiological conditions is unclear. Furthermore, ISK may be enhanced in ventricles by heart failure, but whether by [Ca2+]i elevation in the non-failing ventricle is unknown. Aims: To test whether ISK flows under normal or increased global Ca2+]i, or with sub-sarcolemmal [Ca2+]i increase from APs in human and rabbit atrial cells. Also, to test an ISK blocker, ICAGEN (ICA), on rabbit left ventricular (LV) ion currents under [Ca2+]i elevation from Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (INa/Ca) stimulation. Methods: Myocytes were isolated enzymatically from hearts removed from anaesthetised rabbits, and from atrial tissues from consenting patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Whole-cell patch clamp (37\u00b0C) was used to record ion currents and APs (at 1, 2 or 3Hz), with [Ca2+]i measured using Fura-2. Results: A positive control tested stability/timing of K+ current (IK1) block: Ba2+(0.5 mM) significantly and reversibly decreased inward IK1 (at-115 mV) in 94% of LV cells, from -38.9\u00b15.9 to -12.9\u00b14.5 pA/pF (by 67%), and in 92% of atrial cells, by 43% (P0.05) at any [Ca2+]i, in rabbit or human (5-26 cells, 7-11 rabbits, 3-4 patients). APs recorded at 1 Hz (rabbit) were prolonged by 4-AP (ITO blocker; positive control): action potential depolarization at 30% repolarization (APD30) by 72%, at 70% repolarization (APD70) by 31%. By contrast, ICA (1 \u00b5M) had no effect on APD30-90, maximum diastolic potential (MDP), or Vmax, in human or rabbit. ICA at 10 \u00b5M (non-specific) increased APD70-90 vs time-matched controls. At 2 or 3 Hz, 1 \u00b5M ICA again had no effect on APs. In rabbit LV cells, stimulating INa/Ca increased [Ca2+]i (up to 2.8 \u00b5M) and inward /outward currents. ICA (1 \u00b5M) had no effect on [Ca2+]i or currents, whereas subsequent NiCl2 (10 mM; INa/Ca blocker) decreased them. By contrast, ICA 10 \u00b5M decreased outward (by 35%) and inward (49%) current, and [Ca2+]i (77%), with no effect of subsequent NiCl2. Conclusions: In rabbit and human atrial isolated myocytes, ISK may not flow under physiological conditions, nor during short bursts of supra-physiological stimulation, so atrial ISK activation (and thus its potential pharmacological inhibition during AF) may require changes to cellular electrophysiology or cell signalling systems to develop a sensitivity to ISK iii block. Furthermore, in non-failing LV myocytes, 1 \u00b5M ICA-sensitive ISK may not be  activated by [Ca2+]i-elevation, and high ICA conc. may inhibit INa/Ca", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", "doi": "10.5525/gla.thesis.81927", "subjects": ["Thesis", "NonPeerReviewed"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/372715009.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/372715009.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/372715009", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/81927/8/2021GiommiPhD.pdf", "http://theses.gla.ac.uk/81927/"]}, {"authors": ["Redl, T."], "title": "Masculine generic pronouns: Investigating the processing of an unintended gender cue", "datePublished": "2021-01-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "Radboud University Nijmegen", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/doctoralThesis"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/358466071.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/358466071.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/358466071", "http://hdl.handle.net/21.11116/0000-0007-797A-9", "http://hdl.handle.net/21.11116/0000-0007-797C-7"]}, {"authors": ["H\u00f6dl, Stephanie", "Carrette, Sofie", "Meurs, Alfred", "Carrette, Evelien", "Mertens, Ann", "Gadeyne, Stefanie", "Goossens, Lutgart", "Dewaele, Frank", "Bouckaert, Charlotte", "Dauwe, Ine", "Proesmans, Silke", "Raedt, Robrecht", "Boon, Paul", "Vonck, Kristl"], "title": "Neurophysiological investigations of drug resistant epilepsy patients treated with vagus nerve stimulation to differentiate responders from non-responders", "description": "Background and purpose In patients treated with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for drug resistant epilepsy (DRE), up to a third of patients will eventually not respond to the therapy.

At the level of brain structure, there has not been clear consensus on what the most appropriate tools and techniques are for investigating individual differences. At the level of brain function, the link between spatial (where) and temporal (when) aspects of the neural correlates of emotional processing remains unclear. Thus, there is a need to develop and capitalize on novel comprehensive approaches for the examination of emotional factors at multiple levels (i.e., brain structure, brain function, behavior, and individual differences), in order to elucidate the mechanisms of emotion-cognition interactions. These issues were investigated in a series of studies using an interdisciplinary multi-method approach involving structural and functional brain imaging (i.e., structural magnetic resonance imaging, MRI; functional MRI; event-related optical signal, EROS; electroencephalography/event-related potential, EEG/ERP), a cognitive task involving emotion-cognition interactions (i.e., the emotional oddball paradigm), and measures of individual differences (i.e., cognitive reappraisal, positive affectivity, optimism). Such a comprehensive approach is essential to elucidate mechanisms of emotional functioning, which will contribute to the development of novel theoretical frameworks and the design of assessment tools and interventions that promote emotional well-being.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "datePublished": "2021-02-08T18:44:50", "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "year": 2021, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/186334960", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/102882"]}, {"authors": ["Yuste, Rafael", "Hawrylycz, M.", "Aalling, N.", "Aguilar-Valles, A.", "Arendt, D.", "Arnedillo, R.A.", "Ascoli, Giorgio A.", "Bielza, Concha", "Bokharaie, V.", "Bergmann, T.B.", "Bystron, I.", "Capogna, M.", "Chang, Y.", "Clemens, A.", "de Kock, C.P.J.", "DeFelipe, Javier", "Dos Santos, S.E.", "Dunville, K.", "Feldmeyer, Dirk", "Fi\u00e1th, R.", "Fishell, G.J.", "Foggetti, A.", "Gao, X.", "Ghaderi, P.", "Goriounova, N.A.", "G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn, O.", "Hagihara, K.", "Hall, V.J.", "Helmstaedter, M.", "Herculano, S.", "Hilscher, M.M.", "Hirase, H.", "Hjerling-Leffler, J.", "Hodge, R.", "Huang, J.", "Huda, R.", "Khodosevich, K.", "Kiehn, O.", "Koch, H.", "Kuebler, E.S.", "K\u00fchnemund, M.", "Larra\u00f1aga, P.", "Lelieveldt, B.", "Louth, E.L.", "Lui, J.H.", "Mansvelder, H.D.", "Martinez-Trujillo, J.", "Moradi Chameh, H.", "Serrano-Saiz, E."], "title": "A community-based transcriptomics classification and nomenclature of neocortical cell types", "description": "To understand the function of cortical circuits, it is necessary to catalog their cellular diversity.

Single-cell transcriptomics is enabling, for the first time, systematic high-throughput measurements of cortical cells and generation of datasets that hold the promise of being complete, accurate and permanent. Statistical analyses of these data reveal clusters that often correspond to cell types previously defined by morphological or physiological criteria and that appear conserved across cortical areas and species. To capitalize on these new methods, we propose the adoption of a transcriptome-based taxonomy of cell types for mammalian neocortex. This classification should be hierarchical and use a standardized nomenclature. It should be based on a probabilistic definition of a cell type and incorporate data from different approaches, developmental stages and species. A community-based classification and data aggregation model, such as a knowledge graph, could provide a common foundation for the study of cortical circuits.

My thesis work covered two topics centered on zebrafish. Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 focused on the swimming behavior of the animal. This topic is of great interest because animal behavior is the direct reflection of neural activity. In particular, because of the episodic nature of the swimming behavior of larval zebrafish, the quantitative analysis of its behavior presents potential in bridging behavior and underlying neural control. In Chapter 1, I looked into the escape response behavior in 2D. Combining an objective behavior analysis approach with a simple neurokinematic model, I was able to explain the difference between two types of escape response behavior by the difference in their corresponding neural circuits. The results from my non-invasive analysis agreed with previous findings in invasive electrophysiological studies, in contradiction with some unconstrained swimming studies. In Chapter 2, I extended the swimming behavior analysis into three dimensions. I developed a physical model-based tracking algorithm that captured both fish position and shape in 3D during swim bouts. I analyzed the swimming behavior in a 3D environment and compared with the behavior in 2D. My results showed a distinction between the behavior in 2D and 3D environments and this distinction revealed that past studies in 2D may not faithfully capture the behavioral repertoire of larval zebrafish in the natural environment. In Chapter 3, still using zebrafish as the model organism, I studied protein folding dynamics in differentiated tissues in a living organism. With CPLC postdoc Caitlin Davis, I developed a customized pipeline that integrates meganuclease-mediated mosaic transformation with fluorescence-detected temperature-jump microscopy to probe dynamics and stability of endogenously expressed proteins in different tissues of living zebrafish.LimitedAuthor requested closed access (OA after 2yrs) in Vireo ETD syste", "datePublished": "2100-01-12T00:00:00", "subjects": ["Thesis", "text"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/291799304", "http://hdl.handle.net/2142/106446"]}, {"authors": ["Rodrigues, Jo\u00e3o Pedro Gon\u00e7alves"], "title": "Frequ\u00eancia de recorda\u00e7\u00e3o de sonhos e mem\u00f3ria visual", "description": "Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de Mestrado, Neuroci\u00eancias Cognitivas e Neuropsicologia, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias Humanas e Sociais, Universidade do Algarve, 2014A maioria das pessoas estimam lembrar-se dos seus sonhos cerca de dois a tr\u00eas dias por semana, contudo para algumas pessoas a recorda\u00e7\u00e3o dos sonhos acontece quase todos os dias, enquanto outras pessoas afirmam nunca se lembrar.

The improvement of neural probes through new manufacture methods and the investigation of new materials aims to reduce the impact of probe\u2019s insertion in the brain and extracting the maximum of information.\r\nOptogenetics is a technique that combines the neurons electrical recording in neural probes with optics and genetics. Genetics are used to insert proteins into neurons (called opsins) and make them sensitive to light at a given wavelength. Neural probes for use in optogenetics should be able to deliver light to neurons (stimulator/inhibitor, depending on opsin and light wavelength), while recording the neurons electrical signal. Neural probes for use in optogenetics are called optrodes.\r\nThe main objective of this dissertation is to develop an optrode in silicon substrate for deep brain stimulation/recording. The optrode will have several \u03bc-electrodes (recording points) and a \u03bc-LED in order to stimulate/inhibit the neurons through the emission of light at a given wavelength. The manufacturing techniques used for optrode fabrication were lithography (for patterning of \u03bc-electrodes, connection lines and contacts), deposition of thin films by physical vapour deposition (to form \u03bc-electrodes, connection lines and contacts) and dicing cut to define the optrode geometry.\r\nThe optrode was characterized by performing tests in mechanics, optics, electrochemistry and resistance to application conditions. The mechanical characterization of the optrode was performed by measuring the force upon insertion/removal into gelatine agar agar and calf brain cadaver. The optical characterization was performed by measuring the light intensity of the \u03bc-LED coupled to the optrode. Electrochemical characterization was achieved by impedance spectroscopy of \u03bc-electrodes, using their impedance at 1 kHz (frequency at which neurons interact) as a reference. Resistance to application conditions was tested by subjecting the optrode to adverse conditions comparable to those of the brain, performing impedance spectroscopy tests on \u03bc-electrodes over time", "datePublished": "2022-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/189165162",

The basic claim underlying musical embodiment is that subjective meaning, in its broadest sense, is actively constructed within humans\u2019 bodily interaction with music. As such, the empirical study of bodily coordination may provide insights into the subjective aspects of musical experiences. In the present paper, we advocate for a dynamical systems approach to human music interaction, focusing on the time-varying principles, and the relational aspects of the musical interaction process. We propose a model that integrates these focus points, to investigate the link between embodied coordination dynamics, subjective experience and sense-making. We then discuss possible quantitative and qualitative techniques that allow to operationalise the model into concrete empirical music research.

The study was carried out by using activated sludge samples from the Faro Northwest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to isolate bacteria under aerobic conditions in order to test their resistance in the presence of FLX and EE2 and investigate the biodegradability of chosen pharmaceuticals. In the present study, the identification of bacterial isolates was performed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene of the obtained resistant bacteria. The obtained isolates which showed the ability to grow in the presence of 20 and 50 mg/L FLX were Pseudomonas putida, Enterobacter ludwigii, Pseudomonas nitritireducens, Alcaligenes faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas nitroreducens and in the presence of 15 mg/L EE2 were Acinetobacter bouvetii, Acinetobacter kookii, Pantoea agglomerans Shinella zoogloeoides. These isolates were identified as FLX and EE2 degraders for the first time. FLX and EE2 biodegradation assays was performed in liquid medium. The results showed that for 20 mg/L FLX the bacterial isolate Pseudomonas nitroreducens displayed the highest removal efficiency of 55 \u00b1 1% and for 15 mg/L EE2 Pantoea agglomerans removed 64 \u00b1 4% of the drug.

Moreover, it emphasizes that CBT course programs would benefit from neuroscience training and that continued education to keep track with the latest developments in neuroscience are helpful for good CBT practice", "datePublished": "2022-02-28T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1016/j.brat.2019.103545", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["journalArticle", "info:eu-repo/semantics/article", "info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/287939029", "https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8654066/file/8654070", "https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8654066", "http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-8654066", "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2019.103545"]}, {"authors": ["Guti\u00e9rrez Gal\u00e1n, Daniel", "Dom\u00ednguez Morales, Juan Pedro", "P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a, Fernando", "Linares Barranco, Alejandro"], "title": "NeuroPod: a real-time neuromorphic spiking CPG applied to robotics", "description": "Initially, robots were developed with the aim of making our life easier, carrying\r\nout repetitive or dangerous tasks for humans. Although they were able\r\nto perform these tasks, the latest generation of robots are being designed\r\nto take a step further, by performing more complex tasks that have been\r\ncarried out by smart animals or humans up to date. To this end, inspiration\r\nneeds to be taken from biological examples. For instance, insects are able\r\nto optimally solve complex environment navigation problems, and many researchers\r\nhave started to mimic how these insects behave. Recent interest in\r\nneuromorphic engineering has motivated us to present a real-time, neuromorphic,\r\nspike-based Central Pattern Generator of application in neurorobotics,\r\nusing an arthropod-like robot. A Spiking Neural Network was designed and\r\nimplemented on SpiNNaker. The network models a complex, online-change\r\ncapable Central Pattern Generator which generates three gaits for a hexapod\r\nrobot locomotion. Recon gurable hardware was used to manage both\r\nthe motors of the robot and the real-time communication interface with the\r\nSpiking Neural Networks. Real-time measurements con rm the simulation\r\nresults, and locomotion tests show that NeuroPod can perform the gaits\r\nwithout any balance loss or added delay.Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad TEC2016-77785-", "datePublished": "2022-03-01T00:00:00", "publisher": "'Elsevier BV'", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/article", "info:eu-repo/semantics/submittedVersion"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/288003301.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/288003301.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/288003301", "https://idus.us.es/handle//11441/92803"]}, {"authors": ["ten Dam, L."], "title": "Limb girdle muscular dystrophies", "datePublished": "2022-10-23T00:00:00", "doi": "10.1111/ene.12984", "publisher": "'Wiley'", "subjects": ["doctoralThesis"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "https://core.ac.uk/download/376286431.pdf", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/376286431.pdf", "https://core.ac.uk/display/376286431", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269342/Back_matter.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269205/Front_matter.pdf", "https://dare.uva.nl/personal/pure/en/publications/limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophies(05cb0608-6837-4c99-80f2-2acef86be255).html", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269209/Chapter_2.pdf", "http://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/05cb0608-6837-4c99-80f2-2acef86be255", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269207/Chapter_1.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.1111/cge.13544", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269211/Chapter_3.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269219/Chapter_7.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269221/cover.jpg", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2014.07.004", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269213/Chapter_4.pdf", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269215/Chapter_5.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nmd.2013.03.012", "https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/51269340/Chapter_8.pdf", "https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.12984"]}, {"authors": ["Souto, M\u00e1rcio Rafael Rodrigues"], "title": "Optrode em sil\u00edcio com \u03bc-LED integrado", "description": "Disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de mestrado integrado em Engenharia Eletr\u00f3nica Industrial e ComputadoresNos dias que correm, as sondas neuronais s\u00e3o amplamente utilizadas na \u00e1rea da neuroci\u00eancia para estudar o comportamento e mapeamento cerebral bem como desmistificar a origem de doen\u00e7as associadas ao foro neurol\u00f3gico.

The improvement of neural probes through new manufacture methods and the investigation of new materials aims to reduce the impact of probe\u2019s insertion in the brain and extracting the maximum of information.\r\nOptogenetics is a technique that combines the neurons electrical recording in neural probes with optics and genetics. Genetics are used to insert proteins into neurons (called opsins) and make them sensitive to light at a given wavelength. Neural probes for use in optogenetics should be able to deliver light to neurons (stimulator/inhibitor, depending on opsin and light wavelength), while recording the neurons electrical signal. Neural probes for use in optogenetics are called optrodes.\r\nThe main objective of this dissertation is to develop an optrode in silicon substrate for deep brain stimulation/recording. The optrode will have several \u03bc-electrodes (recording points) and a \u03bc-LED in order to stimulate/inhibit the neurons through the emission of light at a given wavelength. The manufacturing techniques used for optrode fabrication were lithography (for patterning of \u03bc-electrodes, connection lines and contacts), deposition of thin films by physical vapour deposition (to form \u03bc-electrodes, connection lines and contacts) and dicing cut to define the optrode geometry.\r\nThe optrode was characterized by performing tests in mechanics, optics, electrochemistry and resistance to application conditions. The mechanical characterization of the optrode was performed by measuring the force upon insertion/removal into gelatine agar agar and calf brain cadaver. The optical characterization was performed by measuring the light intensity of the \u03bc-LED coupled to the optrode. Electrochemical characterization was achieved by impedance spectroscopy of \u03bc-electrodes, using their impedance at 1 kHz (frequency at which neurons interact) as a reference. Resistance to application conditions was tested by subjecting the optrode to adverse conditions comparable to those of the brain, performing impedance spectroscopy tests on \u03bc-electrodes over time", "datePublished": "2022-01-01T00:00:00", "subjects": ["info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis"], "year": 2022, "downloadUrl": "", "database": "CORE", "url": ["https://core.ac.uk/display/380799228",
