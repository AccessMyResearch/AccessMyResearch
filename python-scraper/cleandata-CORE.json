		"description": "Provision of quality services is one of the most important priorities in higher education institutions. This quality comes from the combination of excellent learning process and students\u2019 satisfaction on the service delivered. Positive perception or acceptance on quality of services is vital to ensure the sustainability of higher learning. Therefore, this study aims to analyze students\u2019 perception towards amenities provided by a public university in Terengganu. The amenities investigated in the study consisted of lecture rooms, laboratory, cafeteria, hostel, vehicle and traffic, and electricity and water supply. The primary data of this study was collected using questionnaires. Participants of the study consisted of 108 students who were randomly selected. The study revealed that students\u2019 perceptions towards amenities provided were average with the score mean value 4.62. The students agreed that the lecture rooms provided by the university are mostly conducive and comfortable. However, the students were mostly not satisfied with the cafeteria. Thus, it is hoped that the finding of the study can give insights to the public university management to improve the amenities towards achieving sustainability of campuses",

		"title": "Human Activity Recognition based on Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Relations",
		"description": "Human activity, which usually consists of several actions, generally covers\ninteractions among persons and or objects. In particular, human actions involve\ncertain spatial and temporal relationships, are the components of more\ncomplicated activity, and evolve dynamically over time. Therefore, the\ndescription of a single human action and the modeling of the evolution of\nsuccessive human actions are two major issues in human activity recognition. In\nthis paper, we develop a method for human activity recognition that tackles\nthese two issues. In the proposed method, an activity is divided into several\nsuccessive actions represented by spatio temporal patterns, and the evolution\nof these actions are captured by a sequential model. A refined comprehensive\nspatio temporal graph is utilized to represent a single action, which is a\nqualitative representation of a human action incorporating both the spatial and\ntemporal relations of the participant objects. Next, a discrete hidden Markov\nmodel is applied to model the evolution of action sequences. Moreover, a fully\nautomatic partition method is proposed to divide a long-term human activity\nvideo into several human actions based on variational objects and qualitative\nspatial relations. Finally, a hierarchical decomposition of the human body is\nintroduced to obtain a discriminative representation for a single action.\nExperimental results on the Cornell Activity Dataset demonstrate the efficiency\nand effectiveness of the proposed approach, which will enable long videos of\nhuman activity to be better recognized",

The primary research question that guided this study was, \u201cWhat are African immigrant families\u2019 perceptions of their children\u2019s experiences in U.S. public schools?\u201d This phenomenon was explored to uncover meanings African immigrant parents from Liberia attached to their children\u2019s experiences in U.S. schools. The focus was on hearing stories the children told their parents about their experiences in U.S. public schools. Nonprobability sampling method was used to recruit participants. Eight families from Liberia, West Africa, were randomly selected to participate in the study. Questionnaire, one-on-one, face-to-face, semistructured interviews, and focus group sessions were used to gather data from participants. The findings are based on a thematic analysis of the data. The findings are based on these categories: challenges reported involving teachers, challenges reported involving peers (fellow students), parents\u2019 responses and reactions, the schools\u2019 response to the reported experiences, and meanings parents attached to the reported experiences. The findings are divided into these subsections: sociocultural stressors encountered by African immigrant students, cultural conflicts between U.S. schools and African immigrant families, role parental involvement played in minimizing sociocultural stressors to help immigrant children succeed in U.S. schools, and educators\u2019 response to sociocultural stressors affecting African immigrant students. The study concludes with practical suggestions to enable African immigrant students adapt well in U.S. schools",

		"title": "Methodology for the selection and implementation of environmental aspects and performance indicators in ports",
		"description": "It is broadly known that efficient ports are crucial for the economic development of their surrounding area. However, the loading and unloading of goods in the ports, the related ship traffic, and the hinterland distribution can cause a number of negative environmental impacts.\n\nIn this thesis, the concepts of environmental aspects and indicators are reviewed, as two relevant elements used in the environmental management. The importance of both elements within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise that the identification of environmental aspects and the use of indicators are essential processes, they do not specify any methodology to undertake these tasks. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already identified their significant aspects and performance indicators, most of these ports do not use any standardized method. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports may not necessarily be science-based, systematic in approach or appropriate for the purpose of implementing effective environmental management.\n\nFor these reasons, it was detected that a new methodology able to identify port' aspects and their most adequate indicators was needed. The developed methodology is called EPORTS.CAT and it comprises two main tools: a Tool for the identification and assessment of Environmental Aspects in Ports (TEAP) and a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP). The first aims at the identification of the major environmental aspects that may be generated in a port and the assessment of their significance (TEAP); and the second at the identification of performance indicators that are related with the aspects and the provision of guidelines for their implementation (TEIP).\n\nThis method has been developed after analysing the strengths, weaknesses and challenges of the existing techniques, the recommendations from the Environmental Management System (EMS) standards and the advice of specialists. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user (i.e. port environmental manager). This new\n\nmethodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. EPORTS.CAT is a practical and time-saving tool for port managers to easily determine significant aspects and indicators in their port areas.\u00c9s \u00e0mpliament reconegut que els ports s\u00f3n crucials per al desenvolupament econ\u00f2mic de les \u00e0rees del seu entorn. No obstant, la c\u00e0rrega i desc\u00e0rrega de mercaderies en els ports, el tr\u00e0fic de vaixells, aix\u00ed com la distribuci\u00f3 de mercaderies cap a l\u2019interior poden causar una s\u00e8rie d\u2019impactes ambientals negatius. En aquesta tesi s\u2019analitzen els conceptes d\u2019aspecte i indicador ambientals, que s\u00f3n dos elements rellevants utilitzats en la gesti\u00f3 ambiental. Tamb\u00e9 es justifica la import\u00e0ncia que tenen tots dos elements dins d\u2019un Sistema de Gesti\u00f3 Ambiental (SGA). Encara que les normes dels SGA reconeixen que la identificaci\u00f3 dels aspectes ambientals i l'\u00fas d'indicadors s\u00f3n processos essencials, no especifiquen cap metodologia per a realitzar aquestes tasques. A m\u00e9s, la recerca duta a terme en aquesta tesi demostra que, si b\u00e9 hi ha un alt percentatge de ports europeus que ja han identificat els seus aspectes significatius i indicadors, la majoria d'aquests ports no utilitzen cap m\u00e8tode estandarditzat. Aix\u00f2 suggereix que alguns dels procediments utilitzats pels ports poden no tenir necess\u00e0riament una base cient\u00edfica, o b\u00e9, no ser sistem\u00e0tics o apropiats per al prop\u00f2sit d\u2019implementar una correcta gesti\u00f3 ambiental. Per aquestes raons, es va detectar que era necess\u00e0ria una nova metodologia capa\u00e7 d'identificar aspectes ambientals en ports i els seus indicadors m\u00e9s adequats. La metodologia desenvolupada es diu EPORTS.CAT i consta de dues eines principals: la Tool for the identification and assessment of Environmental Aspects in Ports (TEAP) i la Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP). La primera t\u00e9 per objectiu identificar els principals aspectes ambientals que poden generar-se en un port i avaluar-ne la seva significan\u00e7a (TEAP); i la segona identificar els indicadors que estan relacionats amb els aspectes i proveir de directrius per a la seva correcta aplicaci\u00f3 (TEIP). Aquest m\u00e8tode ha estat desenvolupat despr\u00e9s d'analitzar els punts forts i febles de les t\u00e8cniques existents, les recomanacions de les normes dels Sistemes de Gesti\u00f3 Ambiental (SGA) i l\u2019assessorament d\u2019especialistes. Es tracta d'una eina amb una base cient\u00edfica i inform\u00e0tica (www.eports.cat) que proporciona un c\u00e0lcul r\u00e0pid, i est\u00e0 dissenyada per a ser tan f\u00e0cil d'usar com sigui possible. Aquesta nova metodologia \u00e9s aplicable a tot tipus de ports sense importar la seva mida, ubicaci\u00f3 geogr\u00e0fica o perfil comercial; proporciona resultats espec\u00edfics per a cada un. EPORTS.CAT \u00e9s una eina pr\u00e0ctica i que permet estalviar temps als responsables  portuaris per tal de determinar f\u00e0cilment els aspectes i indicadors significatius en les seves zones portu\u00e0ries",

		"title": "Quality early childhood education at low fees:case study in Chennai, India",
		"description": "Abstract. The ubiquity and the poor quality of low-fee private schools in India and other developing countries are well-researched subjects. Studies have also shown that parents from low-income households in these countries are increasingly enrolling their children in these schools. However, not much research has been done on the subset of low-fee private schools that provide good quality education in spite of the financial and systemic challenges associated with such schools. This qualitative case study aims to understand how one such low-fee private school in Chennai, India works to provide good quality early childhood education (ECE).\r\n\r\nThe case study was guided by five theoretical propositions and two rival propositions which were based on established conceptual frameworks such as Rowan\u2019s (1997) \u2018teachers\u2019 effectiveness framework,\u2019 Hallinger\u2019s (2011) \u2018leadership for learning model,\u2019 and distributed leadership. The study relied on three types of data sets to help triangulate the findings: (1) classroom observation notes and the rating of the ECE environment using the Tamil Nadu Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (TECERS); (2) semi-structured, in-depth interviews with four preprimary teachers and four school leaders; and (3) relevant documents such as lesson plans used by the preprimary teachers and various webpages from the school\u2019s website.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the study validated the theoretical propositions while invalidating the rival propositions. The results point to two key drivers of the good quality ECE in the case study school: (1) motivated and capable teachers, and (2) a distributed school leadership that was focused on learning. The findings also brought out the critical role of the school leadership in creating an enabling school culture and in building teacher capacity. Furthermore, the findings validate the conceptual frameworks in the context of low-fee private schools in urban India. However, acknowledging that the findings could have local relevance, further research is recommended in other low-fee private schools in diverse contexts to understand their universal applicability across low-fee private schools in India and other developing countries",

		"description": "High school marching bands have several performance options beyond the Friday night football game.  These options range from non-competitive regional festivals to performance circuits that culminate in a final national contest.  All of these extra-curricular events require resources such as funding, equipment, staffing, and parental involvement (Corral, 2001).   \r\n\r\nThe fundamental question was created to investigate opportunities available for participation in music regardless of socioeconomic status, geographic location, etc.  Participation in music was explored from the vantage point of marching band \u2013 one of the most resource intensive programs in music.  Marching band was used in this study because the activity often requires resources that go above and beyond what many administrators, parents, and some directors claim justifiable.   \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this causal-comparative study was to examine the effects that resources, financial and otherwise, have on directors\u2019 decisions to participate in marching band competitions.  High school marching bands from across the United States were compared to determine the amount of finances and resources invested by each program.  The purpose was to find out if resources play a role in a band director\u2019s decision to compete at various national or non-national events.      \r\n\r\nStudents who desire to participate in music should have the opportunity to participate in any extra-curricular event without regard to economic distinction.  Even though marching arts are not offered at all high schools, those who do commit to investing extreme time and resources to the activity.  The nature of marching band, coupled with the relatively small amount of scholarly research on marching bands and resources, made it a unique scenario worthy of further inquiry",

		"description": "One of the alternatives to overcome network scalability problem and maintaining reliability is using MPLS VPN network. In reallity, the current network is already using a multiplatform of several different hardware vendors, i.e., Cisco and Juniper platforms. This paper discusses the comparison of the simulation results to see interoperability of multiplatform MPLS VPN andreliability through traffic engineering using RSVP-TE and LDP protocols. Both the RSVP and LDP protocols are tested on a stable network and in a recovery mode,as well as non-load conditions and with additional traffic load. The recovery mode is the condition after the failover due to termination of one of the links in the network. The no-load condition means that the network is not filled with additional traffic. There is only traffic from the measurement activity itself. While network conditions with an additional load are conditions where there is an additional UDP packet traffic load of 4.5 Mbps in addition to the measurement load itself. On a stable network and without additional traffic load, the average delay on LDP protocol is 59.41 ms, 2.06 ms jitter, 0.08% packetloss, and 8.99 Mbps throughput. Meanwhile, on RSVP protocol, the average delay is 52.40 ms, 2.39 ms jitter, 12.18% packet loss, and 7.80 Mbps throughput.

		"title": "The independent prospective associations of activity intensity and dietary energy density with adiposity in young adolescents",
		"description": "There is limited evidence on the prospective association of time spent in activity intensity (sedentary (SED), moderate (MPA) or vigorous (VPA) physical activity) and dietary intake with adiposity indicators in young people. This study aimed to assess associations between (1) baseline objectively measured activity intensity, dietary energy density (DED) and 4-year change in adiposity and (2) 4-year change in activity intensity/DED and adiposity at follow-up. We conducted cohort analyses including 367 participants (10 years at baseline, 14 years at follow-up) with valid data for objectively measured activity (Actigraph), DED (4-d food diary), anthropometry (waist circumference (WC), %body fat (%BF), fat mass index (FMI), weight status) and covariates. Linear and logistic regression models were fit, including adjustment for DED and moderateto-vigorous physical activity. Results showed that baseline DED was associated with change in WC (\u03b2 for 1 kJ/g difference: 0\u00b771; 95 % CI 0\u00b726, 1\u00b717), particularly in boys (1\u00b726; 95 % CI 0\u00b741, 2\u00b716 v. girls: 0\u00b726; 95 % CI \u22120\u00b734, 0\u00b787), but not with %BF, FMI or weight status. In contrast, baseline SED, MPA or VPA were not associated with any of the outcomes. Change in DED was negatively associated with FMI (\u03b2 for 1 kJ/g increase: \u22120\u00b786; 95 % CI \u22121\u00b759, \u22120\u00b712) and %BF (\u22120\u00b786; 95 % CI \u22121\u00b725, \u22120\u00b711) but not WC (\u22120\u00b727; 95 % CI \u22121\u00b702, 0\u00b748). Change in SED, MPA and VPA did not predict adiposity at follow-up. In conclusion, activity intensity was not prospectively associated with adiposity, whereas the directions of associations with DED were inconsistent. To inform public health efforts, future studies should continue to analyse longitudinal data to further understand the independent role of different energy-balance behaviours in changes in adiposity in early adolescence",

It discusses the use of wikis for learning L2, focusing on learning writing through collaborative tasks. The discussion analyses views and theories on the use of wikis for developing writing skills and the issues associated with the use of wikis for collaborative tasks. The research engages L2 students and a teacher in a task using Wikispaces, an educational type of wikis. The data is collected via a questionnaire, interviews and the teacher\u2019s diary. The study suggests wikis might usefully assist students with their L2 writing and that students are likely to value the opportunity to work collaboratively on a writing task or certain type of task. However, not all students would be expected to feel comfortable with the wiki technology and its features. As wikis are still increasingly popular in language classrooms, a more in-depth study that would take a closer look at the usefulness of wikis for such classroom tasks might bring new insights and interesting results to the discussion on wikis in the English language classroom (ELT). It is suggested, therefore, that future research with a larger and more diverse audience and with a more specific focus might provide better information in this regard",

		"title": "Reliability and Validity of the Telephone-Based eHealth Literacy Scale Among Older Adults: Cross-Sectional Survey",
		"description": "Background: Only a handful of studies have examined reliability and validity evidence of scores produced by the 8-item eHealth literacy Scale (eHEALS) among older adults. Older adults are generally more comfortable responding to survey items when asked by a real person rather than by completing self-administered paper-and-pencil or online questionnaires. However, no studies have explored the psychometrics of this scale when administered to older adults over the telephone.\r\nObjective: The objective of our study was to examine the reliability and internal structure of eHEALS data collected from older adults aged 50 years or older responding to items over the telephone.\r\nMethods: Respondents (N=283) completed eHEALS as part of a cross-sectional landline telephone survey. Exploratory structural equation modeling (E-SEM) analyses examined model fit of eHEALS scores with 1-, 2-, and 3-factor structures. Subsequent analyses based on the partial credit model explored the internal structure of eHEALS data.\r\nResults: Compared with 1- and 2-factor models, the 3-factor eHEALS structure showed the best global E-SEM model fit indices (root mean square error of approximation=.07; comparative fit index=1.0; Tucker-Lewis index=1.0). Nonetheless, the 3 factors were highly correlated (r range .36 to .65). Item analyses revealed that eHEALS items 2 through 5 were overfit to a minor degree (mean square infit/outfit values <1.0; t statistics less than \u00e2\u20ac\u201c2.0), but the internal structure of Likert scale response options functioned as expected. Overfitting eHEALS items (2-5) displayed a similar degree of information for respondents at similar points on the latent continuum. Test information curves suggested that eHEALS may capture more information about older adults at the higher end of the latent continuum (ie, those with high eHealth literacy) than at the lower end of the continuum (ie, those with low eHealth literacy). Item reliability (value=.92) and item separation (value=11.31) estimates indicated that eHEALS responses were reliable and stable.\r\nConclusions: Results support administering eHEALS over the telephone when surveying older adults regarding their use of the Internet for health information. eHEALS scores best captured 3 factors (or subscales) to measure eHealth literacy in older adults; however, statistically significant correlations between these 3 factors suggest an overarching unidimensional structure with 3 underlying dimensions. As older adults continue to use the Internet more frequently to find and evaluate health information, it will be important to consider modifying the original eHEALS to adequately measure societal shifts in online health information seeking among aging populations.Open Access Fundin",

		"description": "With the adoption of Internet of Things and advanced data analytical technologies in manufacturing firms, the industrial sector has launched an evolutionary journey toward the 4th industrial revolution, or so called Industry 4.0. Industrial big data is a core component to realize the vision of Industry 4.0. However, the implementation and usage of industrial big data tools in manufacturing firms will not merely be a technical endeavor, but can also lead to a thorough management reform. By means of a comprehensive review of literature related to Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing, industrial big data, information systems (IS) and technochange management, this paper aims to analyze potential changes triggered by the application of industrial big data in manufacturing firms, from technological, individual and organizational perspectives. Furthermore, in order to drive these changes more effectively and eliminate potential resistance, a conceptual technochange management model was developed and proposed. Drawn upon theories reported in literature of IS technochange management, this model proposed four types of interventions that can be used to copy with changes initiated by industrial big data technologies, including human process intervention, techno-structural intervention, human resources management intervention and strategic intervention. This model will be of interests and value to practitioners and researchers concerned with business reforms triggered by Industry 4.0 in general and by industrial big data technologies in particular",

		"description": "Washback is a phenomenon found internationally in high stakes examinations. This study set in Indonesia sought to explore the washback influence of the national examination system on the attitudes, behaviours and motivations of teachers, learners and parents (Pearson, 1998). Previous studies on national examination in Indonesia had explored the concept without paying sufficient attention to the context and culture within which washback takes place; a culture where examination corruption remains professionally unacknowledged but all too often remains part of practice.\n\nUsing an interpretivist paradigm this study explored the perceptions of the experiences of teachers, learners and parents involved in the national examination system and identified its washback effect. In particular it explored ways in which the national examination affected teaching and learning practices in final year classrooms that in Indonesia are dominated by the national examination cycle. Finally, the study investigated how students\u2018 experiences in the national examination year might be improved.\n\nThe evidence emerging from the thematic analysis of interviews with eight English teachers, ten parents and focus group discussions with 29 final year students attending junior secondary schools identified three main washback themes. The national examination had influenced participants\u2018 feelings, their perceptions and their practices. All participating groups had participants who reported a wide range of feelings about their experiences of national examination, from neutral feelings to high levels of anxiety. The analysis also indicated that participants in each group had recognised both the positive and negative washback effects of national examination. The use of the examination for selection purposes was perceived to motivate students to learn. However, the findings also suggested that the national examination was considered by members of each group to assess students in ways that were regarded as unfair. All three groups showed how the examination influenced their role and practices as teachers, students and parents. However, although members of both parental and pupil communities made reference to a number of corrupt practices, no teacher acknowledged such practice focusing only on the more conventional washback effects of curriculum narrowing and rehearsal pedagogy.\n\nThe evidence from this study was used to extend a model of the relationship between learning and assessment theory proposed by Baird, et.al. (2017). Only when there is an adequate consideration of the culture within which these theories emerge can there be potential for these theories to have traction in offering a lens through which to interrogate practice. Finding ways to engage with features of Indonesian school culture including anxiety, religion, family expectations, corruption, gender inequality and collectivism is a central part of understanding the nature of national examination washback. Without a deeper understanding and acceptance of the problem, Indonesia, and other countries in similar circumstances, is likely to remain in a cycle of constant innovation with little meaningful, constructive change in the assessment process",

They do not know what they should write when the teacher asks them to write something. Because of that problem, the researcher tries to use guided questions in teaching writing skills by using Practice and Progress book which is written by L.G. Alexander. Guided Questions is a technique which is used to guide the students to write something by giving some questions. Guided Questions will enable the students to write a good paragraph and bring them to a point where they will be capable of writing a paragraph with a minimum of error. The students will not make a serious error so long as they follow the directions. Guided Questions can help the students explore their ideas in learning writing skills.

Based on the data results which are analyzed by using SPSS 16.0, the application of learning writing skills by using guided questions in Practice and Progress book has improved. The data shows that the significant value is 0.000 for experimental class and 0.006 for control class. However, the improvement in experimental class is more significant than in control class is. In other words, it indicates that there is an improvement of students\u2019 writing skills after learning writing by using guided questions in Practice and Progress book which is conducted by the researcher in MAS Darul Ihsan",

		"title": "Embedding sustainability into global supply chains : evidence from Bangladeshi multi-tier apparel suppliers : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Management at Massey University, Albany, Auckland, New Zealand",
		"description": "Sustainability and supply management in global supply chains (GSCs) have received much attention over the recent years from industry leaders, academics, and policy makers worldwide. However, scant attention has been paid to investigating the implementation of sustainable supply management (SSM) practices from the perspective of multi-tier suppliers located in a developing country context. To address this knowledge gap, this study examines why and how Bangladeshi multi-tier apparel suppliers implement SSM practices in GSCs. This study is positioned within an interpretivist paradigm and employs qualitative research methodology, drawing on data from interviews with 7 owners and 39 managers of Bangladeshi multi-tier apparel suppliers and their 15 key stakeholders.\r\nThis thesis contains three empirical findings chapters. The first chapter investigates the factors that drive or hinder multi-tier suppliers\u2019 implementation of SSM practices, drawing on integrative stakeholder theory, institutional theory and contingency theory. The findings suggest that buyers\u2019 requirements, increased factory productivity and external stakeholder expectations are key drivers for multi-tier suppliers to embed SSM practices. Conversely, cost and resource concerns, and gaps in the regulatory framework are dominant barriers encountered by multi-tier suppliers in the effective implementation of SSM practices.\r\nThe second chapter examines how institutional pressures and mechanisms affect the implementation of SSM practices across multi-tier suppliers, and why these suppliers decouple implementation practices. Drawing on institutional theory, the findings indicate that institutional pressures and mechanisms \u2013 coercive, mimetic and normative \u2013 vary across multi-tier suppliers, thereby affecting their divergent implementation of SSM practices. However, managers and owners of multi-tier suppliers apply three key decoupling approaches \u2013 avoidance, defiance and manipulation \u2013 in response to institutional pressures. Specifically, the findings suggest a multiplicity of logics across multi-tier suppliers, which conflict with or complement each other during the SSM implementation process.\r\nThe third chapter investigates how multi-tier apparel suppliers integrate social and environmental issues to improve SSM outcomes. The findings suggest that multi-tier apparel suppliers are implementing various social and environmental practices to improve SSM outcomes. Although the level of implementation of sustainability practices is high within first-tier suppliers, second-tier and third-tier suppliers either adopt specific social practices on an ad hoc basis or symbolically implement environmental practices.\r\nReflecting on the overall findings, this study contributes to theory by offering a series of research propositions and expounding a holistic SSM implementation framework for multi-tier suppliers. In addition, this study provides significant implications for practitioners including factory owners, managers, and policy makers who seek to implement SSM practices in GSCs. The key limitation of this study concerns generalisability due to context-specific challenges. Future research should therefore focus on a cross-country data set to understand any differences in the emerging framework for multi-tier suppliers\u2019 SSM implementation",

		"title": "Sequencing impact at the University of Missouri",
		"description": "Executive Summary: It would be an understatement to say that \"next-generation\" sequencing technology has been revolutionary.  Over the last 10 years, sequencing has created a paradigm shift in biological sciences where more and more a component of research involves \"just sequence it\".  This is because the types of data, applications and resulting insights are expanding every year.  Further, the volume and speed of data generation are growing exponentially, while the costs to generate these data are decreasing exponentially.  The Human Genome Project completed the first draft genome sequence in 2001 at an estimated cost of $3 billion.  Next-generation sequencing became mainstream around 2007 and enabled the re-sequencing of a human genome at a cost of approximately $50,000.  In late 2015, Illumina announced the availability of their X10 sequencer for use on non-human samples enabling the re-sequencing of a mammalian (human, cow, dog etc.) genome for approximately $1,500 and with an annual throughput of 10,000 genomes per year.  The ease, rapidity and cost effectiveness of generating sequence data has created a computational analysis bottleneck.  The growth of computational resources on the MU campus has not kept pace with the growth in data generation capability.  In order for Mizzou to maintain a competitive research environment, we need to expand the computational resources available for bioinformatics analysis of large data which include sequence data.  It will require an initial investment of $619,000 in early 2016 to build the needed core infrastructure and will require ongoing funding to maintain and expand this infrastructure.  Initial investments (cost share of $231,000) made by Mizzou in 2005 to bring next-generation sequencing to this campus have been returned many-fold.  Based on a survey sent to MU researchers in November 2015, a total of 66 grants have been awarded involving sequencing for a total of $87.5M.  $7.6M of that is directly attributable to sequence data generation/analysis. In addition, another $7.9M in grant funding has been submitted and remains pending.  This research has led to 173 refereed journal articles in top-tier journals producing over 6,000 citations.  Additionally, 19 M.S., 62 Ph.D. and 21 postdocs have been trained as a result of these sequence related research projects.  Plant and animal researchers at MU have been at the forefront of the next-generation sequencing revolution.  However, based on the diversity of grants and papers gathered by the survey, sequence analysis provides a common foundation that ties together many disciplines on campus.  As such, investment in computational capacity directed at sequence data analysis will serve the entire campus and provide technological ties between disciplines.  The following is a detailed description of the history of sequencing/bioinformatics, a description of the computation resources required, and a model for sustainability and an analysis of the impacts of next-generation sequencing at Mizzou",

		"description": "This study examines the use of an educational wiki to develop the second language (L2) writing skills of English language students who are placed on a two-week online course to develop skills in English for work-related purposes. It discusses the use of wikis for learning L2, focusing on learning writing through collaborative tasks. The discussion analyses views and theories on the use of wikis for developing writing skills and the issues associated with the use of wikis for collaborative tasks. The research engages L2 students and a teacher in a task using Wikispaces, an educational type of wikis. The data is collected via a questionnaire, interviews and the teacher\u2019s diary. The study suggests wikis might usefully assist students with their L2 writing and that students are likely to value the opportunity to work collaboratively on a writing task or certain type of task. However, not all students would be expected to feel comfortable with the wiki technology and its features. As wikis are still increasingly popular in language classrooms, a more in-depth study that would take a closer look at the usefulness of wikis for such classroom tasks might bring new insights and interesting results to the discussion on wikis in the English language classroom (ELT). It is suggested, therefore, that future research with a larger and more diverse audience and with a more specific focus might provide better information in this regard",

		"description": "College access programs (CAPs) have proliferated throughout the United States to address disparities in college enrollment between White, higher-income students, and racial/ethnic minority and lower-income students. While CAPs have helped to reduce such disparities, considerable challenges remain. U.S. higher education leaders are facing renewed urgency to address this issue because racial/ethnic minority and lower-income groups are now the fastest growing segments of the population, and because educational attainment \u2013 acquisition of a college degree \u2013 is increasingly important to national economic growth and individual well-being. However, to date, only a few researchers have examined CAPs\u2019 influence on participants beyond college enrollment, so there is a knowledge gap regarding the kinds of systems and supports needed to help members of these populations achieve a college degree. This study examines the relationship between CAP participation and the undergraduate experiences and outcomes of CAP alumni who enrolled in college.  \n      The primary data for this study consisted of individual interviews with 24 alumni from five CAPs in the New York City metropolitan area who subsequently attended college. The CAPs varied by primary funding source. Four to six participants per site were college juniors or seniors, recent college graduates, or individuals who enrolled in college but withdrew before graduating and never returned. \n      The data highlighted the following key themes and implications: (1) CAPs in this study were largely successful in helping alumni enroll in colleges and universities known to be selective; (2) While the CAPs exerted helpful influences, alumni nonetheless faced serious challenges through the college years, such as meeting academic demands and navigating barriers of bigotry and intolerance that are deeply embedded on many campuses; and (3) CAPs in this study influenced alumni\u2019s post-college aspirations, directions, and trajectories regarding career choices, and family and community uplift. Drawing on these findings, this study proposed a model of the psychosocial, academic, and sociocultural resources that appear to contribute to the undergraduate experiences, outcomes, and post-college trajectories of CAP alumni. The study concludes with implications for practice, policy and further research",

		"title": "Reviewing risk management tools for construction projects and the implementation of project management strategies",
		"description": "Purpose - The research reviewed risk management tools for construction projects and the implementation of project management strategies, in which prominence is found in the use of the integrated use of value management and risk management adapted from the Integrated Approach for Soft Value Management. The study was based on a school construction project which was used as a case study at which the researcher\u2019s role is that of \u2018Project Manager\u2019. The project status before the study was that it was almost 100% behind schedule and experienced a wide variety of problems ranging from constant site shut-downs due to community protests, contract scope changes, poor quality workmanship and material related setbacks. The study, through literature review, considered some of the methods currently used in the built environment to mitigate unforeseen problems to construction projects and ascertained the extent to which these tools and techniques for risk management on construction projects were used. The idea behind this was to review, document and package the application of a project management strategy that would be suitably effective for resolving the problems faced on the project site. Design \u2013 The research design used in this study was the \u2018Case study design\u2019 and \u2018Experimental design\u2019 in which the \u2018Action-research\u2019 approach and \u2018Embedded survey within a case study\u2019 were employed on the construction project site, managed by the researcher in his capacity as Project Manager. This was done by organising role-players as participants in focus group workshops facilitated by the researcher where the participants interacted with the researcher and amongst themselves in an effort to identify and find possible problems affecting the project. The researcher introduced stimulating action to project management processes based on the information sourced from the literature review and data obtained from focus group workshops where the outcomes were observed, recorded, analysed and conclusions drawn. Results \u2013 The investigation results revealed that the applied management strategies in form of the approach adapted from the integrated use of value and risk management provided a conclusion that the approach was an effective and preferable technique to use in comparison with the commonly used contingencies and float for risk management on construction projects. The above processes also confirmed its relevance as an appropriate technique for risk management of most unforeseen problems which have an effect on the three constraints of time, cost and quality. A further analysis of literature reviewed, which was also supported by other studies previously undertaken, concluded that most professionals in the construction sector such as Quantity Surveyors, Construction Managers, Project Managers and Architects were aware of Value Management but rarely applied it on projects for risk management purposes. Practical Implications \u2013 Developing a standard model for the implementation of measures to deal or manage unplanned problems on a project is a challenge as most projects do not have a set model to deal with unforeseen project problems which compels the reliance on contingencies and float. However, any envisaged model must be supported by a quality control system which allows for easy implementation of interventions. The prototype step model conceptualised by the researcher is intended to enable project functionaries and project managers through its unique and easy steps to navigate through any problem which may be encountered on a project. This is regardless of the project phase in which such challenges manifest as there is no preferred model capable of resolving much more than one setback at any given time in comparison with the strategy recommended by this study, which may also be applicable to other sites where similar dynamics exist. Limitations \u2013 The study was conducted in a confined environment which required to be confirmed through longitudinal research which is broader and based on many different projects hence the results could not be generalised but only limited to the current project and further research was recommended. The single case study design was also a limitation as the results were not broad enough and were also subjective for generalisation to other project sites. Conclusion \u2013 This project management strategy in which the integrated value management approach was used has the potential of being employed as an intervention technique for unforeseen problems related to construction projects provided the processes derived from further research are documented and packaged into a process to be used as a standard model. The project management strategy has the potential to mitigate problems related to time, cost and quality only during the three phases of the project which are, initiation, planning, and implementation and excludes the closing phase to enhance project value. In iii essence, when the project cost and time are effectively managed and reduced, with enhanced quality, the result is an improved project with significant prospects of success",

		"description": "The primary aim of this study was to explore primary school teachers\u2019 experiences that influence\r\ntheir morale in Bohlabela District, Mpumalanga Province in order to improve practice and create\r\na suitable environment for effective teaching and learning. The aim was achieved by exploring\r\nteachers\u2019 experiences, identifying factors which influence the morale of teachers and developing\r\nstrategies which could be applied to motivate teachers in their profession. The empirical inquiry\r\nwas informed by behaviourism as a theoretical framework as well as the extant literature on\r\nteachers\u2019 morale. The study applied an interpretive paradigm which is qualitative in nature to\r\ncollect and analyse teachers\u2019 subjective but accurate accounts of their opinions, experiences and\r\nperceptions regarding their morale. A case study was opted as the research design method and\r\npurposive sampling was used to identify 12 poorly performing rural primary schools and to select\r\ninformation- rich 36 teacher participants, all of who were teaching Grade 6 Mathematics and\r\nEnglish. The primary data gathering technique was focus group interviews with teachers. Data\r\nextracted from the participants were augmented, supported, confirmed and corroborated by\r\nobservations. Data were analysed using a thematic data analysis approach. Data were segmented\r\nand inductively coded into three main themes which served as the main empirical research\r\nfindings. The first theme of this study dealt with experiences that influence teachers\u2019 morale\r\nwhich included boredom, frustrations, lack of professional development and feelings of neglect\r\nand violence.InIn this theme it was found that experiences such as boredom, lack of professional\r\ndevelopment, feelings of neglect and school violence negatively affected the morale of teachers.\r\nThe second theme comprised factors that affect teachers\u2019 morale which included personal factors;\r\nwork related factors and socio-economic factors. Personal factors and work related factors were\r\nalso found to play a negative role in the morale of teachers. The third theme comprised\r\nintervention strategies to enhance teachers\u2019 morale which included improved communication,\r\nfamily support, safety in schools and parental involvement. Based on the findings of the literature\r\nreview and the empirical investigation, recommendations were made for the improvement of\r\npractice. It was concluded in this study that low teacher morale is a challenge in the schooling\r\nsystems globally including South Africa. The study further concluded that low teacher morale\r\nnegatively affects both teachers\u2019 and learners\u2019 productivity. As a way of mitigating problems\r\nassociated with low teacher morale, it was recommended that the Department of Education\r\nshould prioritise the issue of consulting teachers as an important component when developing\r\nprofessional development programmes aimed at assisting teachers, this is thought will assist in\r\nidentifying problem areas which affect the work of teachers which ultimately affects their\r\nmorale.Educational Studie",

Gender stereotypes negatively influence women\u2019s self-efficacy, the internal beliefs of what they are capable of. Women hold themselves back when they respond to these low self-efficacy beliefs, by not aspiring, not applying, not asking, and not acting. This paper explores current leadership gap data and the consequences of the disparity between men and women in leadership roles. Next, the paper describes how stereotypes can create the underlying problem: limiting internal beliefs. This paper proposes an evidence-based solution drawn from the field of positive psychology. A review of decades of research suggests that with increased career self-efficacy, women will be more likely to reach for, persist in, and succeed in senior leadership positions.

		"title": "Community Participation in Socio-Economic Development through Secondary Education in one of the Remotest Regions of Pakistan",
		"description": "This research study was designed to find out the role of community participation in Socio-economic development through secondary education in one of the remotest regions in Pakistan. The objectives of study were to investigate to what extent the community is involved in dissemination of secondary education in public sector, to find out the benefits of community involvement in secondary education, to unpack the issues and challenges faced by teachers due to lack of community participation and to stumble on the character of education in socio-economic development of Baltistan region. Researcher used stratified sampling technique. There are six tehsils in district Skardus i.e. Skardu, Gamba Skardu, Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar and Rondu. To give representation to wide spread geographic region of the Skardu District, these Tehsils were divided into two groups. The group 1 was comprised of Skardu, Gamba Skardu and Roundu while the remaining three Tehsils (Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar) were put into group 2. Seventeen institutions were taken as sample of the study from six Tehsils of the Skardu District formed 44.7% of available 38 Public Sector Secondary Schools in Skardu. Two teachers and the head teacher were contacted for the purpose of data collection from each sample school. Opinion of 13 community notables was also sought through structured interview. The data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics, chi square and percentage methods. On the basis of findings it was concluded that majority teachers and head teachers of secondary schools viewed that the community participation is necessary part of education, majority of teachers, head teachers and community notables viewed that the main reasons of lack of community / parents participation are illiteracy, unawareness and busy life due to economic pressure, all respondents\u2019 teachers, head teachers and community notables have supported the statement that the parent\u2019s active participation can enhance the student\u2019s achievements, and all respondent have responded that Education plays a vital role in socio-economic development of the society. The recommendations of the study included that there is great need to make aware the parents about the importance of their participation in child\u2019s educational achievement, raise awareness about the relation between school and community, repeated contacts and meetings with the SMC members, conduct of seminars, workshops can play a vital role for the development of community participation in education, community members can invite in co-curricular activities like Parent\u2019s days, cleanliness weeks, and prize distribution ceremonies and national and Islamic events, there may be a counseling center in school where counseling of students may be conducted and parents and community members may also be invite, through community involvement it can be possible to make more and more registration of children in the school, and\u00a0 media both print and electronic is also an effective source through which community can be motivated to participate in education",

A hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to determine if technology-based tools, such as online discussion boards, email, social networking sites, and short message service (SMS) texting has made an impact on instructional collaboration for rural middle school teachers. The theory guiding this study was connectivism (Siemens, 2005) as it addresses the concept that in the digital age knowledge is stored outside the learner and distributed knowledge as it relates to the connections formed between individuals and/or networks (Downes, 2005, 2010).  Data collection methods included surveys, individual interviews, focus group interviews, and electronic journaling to provide insight into teacher professional communities and reflective practice.  Data analysis was achieved through the use of the hermeneutic circle and followed van Manen\u2019s approach.  The results of this study indicated teacher collaboration was important for professional growth and the use of technology makes teacher collaboration more efficient.  The hermeneutic phenomenological approach utilized in this study provided rich details to add to the body of research concerning teacher collaboration and the utilization of technology by teachers to give and seek professional support",

		"title": "Investigating the washback effect of the national\n\nexamination on Indonesian practices: Perceptions of\n\nteachers, students and parents of test impact",
		"description": "Washback is a phenomenon found internationally in high stakes examinations. This study set in Indonesia sought to explore the washback influence of the national examination system on the attitudes, behaviours and motivations of teachers, learners and parents (Pearson, 1998). Previous studies on national examination in Indonesia had explored the concept without paying sufficient attention to the context and culture within which washback takes place; a culture where examination corruption remains professionally unacknowledged but all too often remains part of practice.\n\nUsing an interpretivist paradigm this study explored the perceptions of the experiences of teachers, learners and parents involved in the national examination system and identified its washback effect. In particular it explored ways in which the national examination affected teaching and learning practices in final year classrooms that in Indonesia are dominated by the national examination cycle. Finally, the study investigated how students\u2018 experiences in the national examination year might be improved.\n\nThe evidence emerging from the thematic analysis of interviews with eight English teachers, ten parents and focus group discussions with 29 final year students attending junior secondary schools identified three main washback themes. The national examination had influenced participants\u2018 feelings, their perceptions and their practices. All participating groups had participants who reported a wide range of feelings about their experiences of national examination, from neutral feelings to high levels of anxiety. The analysis also indicated that participants in each group had recognised both the positive and negative washback effects of national examination. The use of the examination for selection purposes was perceived to motivate students to learn. However, the findings also suggested that the national examination was considered by members of each group to assess students in ways that were regarded as unfair. All three groups showed how the examination influenced their role and practices as teachers, students and parents. However, although members of both parental and pupil communities made reference to a number of corrupt practices, no teacher acknowledged such practice focusing only on the more conventional washback effects of curriculum narrowing and rehearsal pedagogy.\n\nThe evidence from this study was used to extend a model of the relationship between learning and assessment theory proposed by Baird, et.al. (2017). Only when there is an adequate consideration of the culture within which these theories emerge can there be potential for these theories to have traction in offering a lens through which to interrogate practice. Finding ways to engage with features of Indonesian school culture including anxiety, religion, family expectations, corruption, gender inequality and collectivism is a central part of understanding the nature of national examination washback. Without a deeper understanding and acceptance of the problem, Indonesia, and other countries in similar circumstances, is likely to remain in a cycle of constant innovation with little meaningful, constructive change in the assessment process",

This study used phenomenological research methods to examine the perspectives, practices, and policies of Catholic school educators in inclusive settings through interviews, observations, and artifact reviews of school data to triangulate findings within this research. Surveys completed by administrators and faculty members provided initial knowledge and perspectives of inclusive practices for instruction of students with disabilities (SWDs) within inclusive settings. Structured interviews and classroom observation were then completed with participants at the school to investigate the inclusive practices used within their classrooms and school for SWDs. All data were collected and analyzed from the observations of students with disabilities and educators in inclusive classrooms at the Elementary School site of this study, along with the data from surveys and interviews with the administrators and key faculty members at the school. The analyses across data sources resulted in five key themes attributed to inclusive practices within the school setting. The five themes that emerged were: (a) Catholic educators\\u27 belief to educate all students; (b) support provided of inclusive education; (c) planning for inclusive education; (d) differentiated instruction; and (e) consistency of vision and goals for inclusive education across the grade levels and throughout the school.

		"description": "America\u2019s public school system finds itself strongly challenged at a time when both domestic and world affairs call upon us to rethink the way we develop and prepare our country\u2019s citizens. Unfortunately, countless students in school districts across the Nation daily receive unequal access to information in school, resulting from the inequitable distribution of resources caused by property tax based systems of funding public education.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court declared in Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629 (1950), and Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), that every student is entitled to equal access to equal information undergirding the critical thinking training they receive in schools. However, the Supreme Court sanctioned school funding disparities  caused by property tax based systems by claiming that there is no fundamental right to an education in the United States per the Court\u2019s ruling in San Antonio v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1 (1973). As a result, this paper asserts that the funding disparities resulting from property tax based school funding systems is the chief cause of disparate access to information in schools based purely on where students live. Disparate access to information in schools in turn leads to disparities in critical thinking training since the depth and degree of critical thinking training depends on one\u2019s access to information in school. Disparate access to information in America\u2019s public schools violates students\u2019 First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and adversely affects our children for a lifetime.U of I Onlypatron submitted extension request form; updated by LAC on 07-02-202",

		"title": "Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP)",
		"description": "In this paper, the concept of environmental indicator is reviewed as a relevant element used in the environmental management of any organisation. The importance of this element within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise the relevance of using indicators, they do not specify any methodology to identify which indicators have to be implemented. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already implemented performance indicators, most of them do not mention the method applied to obtain the indicators. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports to identify indicators may not necessarily be science-based or systematic in approach. For these reasons, the need to develop a new methodology able to identify the ports' most adequate indicators was detected. Therefore, a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP) was developed. It aims at identifying performance indicators in ports and providing guidelines for their proper implementation. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat/teip) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly and practical as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user. This new methodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. TEIP aims at helping port managers at easily determining their significant port indicators, which provides valuable elements for the decision-making processes.Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft",

		"title": "Beginning Reading: A Comparative Study of Beginning Reading Phonics Programs",
		"description": "There is a gap in our understanding of effective early reading instructional approaches, particularly regarding identifying which specific core systematic phonics reading programs provide longer-lasting impact on literacy achievement. The purpose of this causal comparative study was to examine the effects of two distinct pre-kindergarten phonics programs, a linguistic phonics program and a basal phonics program, on short and long-term literacy outcomes. The overarching question addressed in this study was whether the type of literacy instruction in pre-kindergarten predicts outcomes in kindergarten and grade 3 and to what extent, if any, these relationships are moderated by demographic variables. More specifically, this study was undertaken to determine whether the type of literacy instruction in pre-kindergarten; a linguistic phonics reading program, Magic Penny (MP), and a basal phonics reading program, Houghton Mifflin (HM), impacts short and/or long-term literacy outcomes as measured by the DIBELS assessment in grade K and grade 3 and the New York State Test of Performance (NYSTP) in grade 3, and to what extent the effects (if any) are attributable to or modified by the demographic variables of gender, economic status, ELL, and race/ethnicity. A total of 594 students from approximately 30 Title 1 designated schools from a large school district in New York State were included in the study. The intervention group consisted of 297 students that received MP instruction in Pre-kindergarten in any of the years from 2009-10 through 2014-15; the control group consisted of 297 randomly selected pre-kindergarten students who received instruction in the HM Pre-Kindergarten literacy program. Binomial logistical regression was executed with extant data from the 594 pre-kindergarten students in order to predict short and long-term literacy outcomes. In this study the type of literacy instruction (MP vs. HM) in pre-kindergarten did not predict proficiency in DIBELS grade K (short-term effect) or grade 3 NYSTP (long-term effect), nor was there demonstrable improvement in the ability to predict if a student was proficient given the student characteristics. A significant difference in reading performance in grade three (long-term effect) between the two programs as measured by the grade 3 DIBELS assessment was demonstrated: Students who received the MP intervention were almost two times more likely to score proficient on the grade 3 DIBELS assessment than students instructed with HM in pre-kindergarten. Ethnicity was negatively correlated with performance for each ethnicity suggesting there are unmeasured factors other than race/ethnicity that overcome a negative effect of race on student\u2019s performance on these assessments that are mitigated by the use of an instructional (linguistic) phonics program such as MP. Though no significant differences between the two reading programs were demonstrable in the foundational skills assessment DIBELS in kindergarten or in the NYSTP grade 3 summative assessment, the results of the foundational skills measured in grade 3 DIBELS are substantial enough to demonstrate the value of a linguistic phonics program such as Magic Penny. Magic Penny instruction in pre-kindergarten resulted in increased literacy achievement in grade 3 foundational literacy skills as well as mitigated the factors attributed to race",

		"title": "School management and educational quality in the context of centralized educational governance in Egypt: Examining stakeholder perceptions in private language schools",
		"description": "The decline in educational quality is a worldwide phenomenon that has caused stakeholders to challenge the structure of current systems of centralized governance. It is argued that decentralization of educational governance that would allow more autonomy and increased decision-making authority at the school level, which would ultimately result in improved educational quality. Private language schools in Egypt should have a degree of autonomy to make decisions that would enable them to provide a higher quality education, within a regulatory framework that supports rather than hinders their progress. In reality, these schools are constrained by the central control of curricula, assessment, teachers, budgets, and decision-making, which are ultimately all the influential aspects that define the status of educational quality. The potential that private national schools have in terms of providing quality education, along with the prevalence of decentralization initiatives and the limited research done on private language schools in Egypt has sparked questions about how these schools operate under such a centralized context and how this context affects the quality of education provided there. Other questions were also raised to explore how much autonomy do stakeholders truly have, and whether or not there is a discrepancy between the policy discourse and the implementation of decentralization initiatives. The perceptions of 38 stakeholders from school principals, teachers, parents and officials from the Ministry of Education are demonstrated in this paper in an attempt to address the above questions. Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews was collected from four private language schools in Egypt. Results show that stakeholders appear frustrated with the lack of autonomy granted to them and view this matter as a hindrance to educational quality. Drawbacks associated with centralization such as bureaucracy, ineffective decision-making, and lack of accountability on teachers continue to manifest in private language schools, Stakeholders have indicated that the schools have the potential to assume further responsibility, autonomy and accountability, yet most influential decision-making still takes place at the highest central levels at the MOE. Further along, data analysis shows that there may be multiple impediments to the true implementation of decentralization. The fact remains that educational decentralization continues to be a debatable subject that is challenging to conceptualize, and further research is required to establish its effects, or lack thereof, on educational quality.    \u00e2\u20ac",

		"title": "Children\u2019s right to education: a case of school fee policies in South Africa.",
		"description": "Masters Degree. University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban.After 1994, the apartheid education system transformed into democratic system aimed at\r\nachieving equity, redress and access to education for all. However, after 20 years of\r\ndemocracy and the introduction of policies and legislation that aim to redress the previous\r\neducational injustices, gaps are still evident. The introduced policies include the South\r\nAfrican School Act (SASA) (Act No. 84 of 1996), the National Norms Standards for School\r\nFunding (NNSSF), the School Fee Exemption Policy (SFEP), and the No Fee School\r\nPolicy (NFSP). Following the implementation of the policies, quintile ranking of schools\r\nwas introduced for the government funding purposes, based on the poverty levels of the\r\ncommunity. Despite these reforms and implementation, many authors are convinced that\r\nthese policies have not produced the desired outcomes, and this requires further\r\nreflection and research.\r\nThe study aimed to explore the impact and effectiveness of the NFSP and SFEP over a\r\n10-year period from 2006\u20132016, in some of the schools in KwaZulu-Natal and Pinetown\r\ndistricts. This was achieved through the critical analysis of learner enrolment and school\r\ndropout data. Furthermore, the study critically analyses factors that influence learner dropout and non-matriculation. According to collected data and available research,\r\nenrolment rates at primary school level and high school level has increased. However, it\r\nis observed from the data that high school dropout is rife particularly from grade 10 to 11.\r\nLearners tend to leave school between grade 10 and 11, based on their socio-economic\r\nstatus, mainly the lack of money to pay school fees. Hence school learner dropout is a\r\nconcern particularly at an advanced stage of schooling, and it has been an on-going\r\nproblem for over 10 years. The study is based on secondary data and statistical data\r\nobtained from the Department of Education in KwaZulu-Natal province",

		"title": "Comparison of multi-distance signal level difference Hjorth descriptor and its variations for lung sound classifications",
		"description": "A biological signal has the multi-scale and signals complexity properties. Many studies have used the signal complexity calculation methods and multi-scale analysis to analyze the biological signal, such as lung sound. Signal complexity methods used in the biological signal analysis include entropy, fractal analysis, and Hjorth descriptor. Meanwhile, the commonly used multi-scale methods include wavelet analysis, coarse-grained procedure, and empirical mode decomposition (EMD). One of the multi-scale methods in the biological signal analysis is the multi-distance signal level difference (MSLD), which calculates a difference between two signal samples at a specific distance. In previous studies, MSLD was combined with Hjorth descriptor for lung sound classification. MSLD has the potential to be developed by modifying the fundamental equation of MSLD. This study presents the comparison of MSLD and its variations combined with Hjorth descriptor for lung sound classification. The results showed that MSLD and its variations had the highest accuracy of 98.99% for five lung sound data classes. The results of this study provided several alternatives for multi-scale signal complexity analysis method for biological signals",

However, the effectiveness of learning is under-studied due to the complexity involved to gamify the assessment concept, particularly when it comes to intangible measures related to the progression of learning outcomes, which is among the most important aspects of evaluation in serious games. This paper reviews the literature regarding assessment due to their importance in the learning process with a detailed assessment plan applied on serious game.

		"title": "Key generic curriculum factors affecting grade twelve learner performance : a multiple case study of South African secondary schools",
		"description": "Improving Grade 12 learner performance is a critical issue because only a few learners are able to go to university. Grade 8 learners lack the required subject content knowledge to be in secondary school. The aim of this study was to identify key generic curriculum factors affecting Grade 12 learner performance. The aim was addressed by conducting the relevant literature study and an empirical investigation.\r\nIn various studies, the implementation of the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) has been associated with tremendous challenges, including content congestion, workload, too much paperwork, too much assessment and limited time. There are ongoing expressions of uncertainty about the type of learners the CAPS is producing. Many of these learners do not understand English, cannot read or write, do not care about their education, are not doing their homework and are ill-disciplined. Against this backdrop of uncertainty, this study offers a critical reflection of key curriculum factors affecting learners\u2019 performance.\r\nThis multiple case study was undertaken using semi-structured individual interviews with 12 Heads of Departments, which were conducted to explore their perceptions and experiences regarding the CAPS. Six focus group interviews with teachers were also conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of their views.\r\nThe findings of the study offer a deeper understanding of the key generic curriculum factors affecting learner performance which require a special intervention at foundation phase to ensure that primary school learners are prepared for Grade 12. It is envisaged that the research findings will assist the Department of Basic Education with decisions relating to improving learners\u2019 performance.\r\nThe study recommends that involving as many experienced teachers as possible in the curriculum design will have a positive impact on learner performance. It is recommended that the Department of Basic Education should reduce the number of subjects at secondary school level; align time allocated to complete the syllabus with the Annual Teaching Plan; replace School-Based Assessments with tests; conduct an exit examination at the end of every phase; identify one prescribed textbook for each subject; encourage top performing students to become teachers; and make teaching a high-status profession. Experienced teachers should be given an opportunity to design the curriculum because they understand the challenges facing the education system. The Department of Basic Education should minimise changes to the curriculum because the teachers work better with what they know.\r\niv\r\nThe study concluded that the first 30 minutes of each day should be an English period to enhance reading skills; learners should be given an opportunity to choose subjects from Grade 8 not from Grade 10; the pass rate should be raised to 50% for all the subjects; Life Orientation should be done only up to Grade 7; more Further Education and Training colleges should be opened so that learners can be directed accordingly if they cannot cope in a mainstream school; progression and adjustment of marks should be stopped; more teacher training colleges should be opened; more and better resources at all under-resourced schools must be provided; each school should have a full-time psychologist on staff; and learners should be motivated regularly by educated or successful community members.Dit is noodsaaklik om die prestasie van Graad 12-leerlinge te verbeter aangesien weinig van hulle aan \u0149 universiteit verder kan studeer. Graad 8-leerders beskik nie oor die vakkennis wat op ho\u00ebrskool van hulle verwag word nie. Die oogmerk van hierdie studie was om vas te stel watter betekenisvolle generiese kurrikulumfaktore die prestasie van Graad 12-leerders bepaal. \u0149 Literatuurstudie en empiriese ondersoek is met die oog hierop gedoen.\r\nVolgens verskeie studies bring die implementering van die Kurrikulum- en Assesseringsbeleidsverklaring (KABV) geweldige uitdagings mee waaronder die vertering van lesinhoud, \u0149 groot werklas, te veel papierwerk, te veel assessering en te min tyd. Bedenkinge word gereeld uitgespreek oor die soort leerder wat die KABV tot gevolg het. Talle leerders verstaan nie Engels nie, kan nie lees of skryf nie, is nie oor hulle eie opvoeding besorg nie, doen nie hulle huiswerk nie, en is ongehoorsaam. Hierdie studie besin krities oor die betekenisvolle kurrikulumfaktore wat leerders se prestasie be\u00efnvloed.\r\nIn hierdie meervoudige gevallestudie is halfgestruktureerde onderhoude met 12 departementshoofde gevoer. Hulle perspepsie en ervaring van die KABV is in die onderhoude verken. Ses fokusgroeponderhoude is met onderwysers gevoer om hulle siening daarvan te verkry.\r\nDie bevindings van die studie bied \u0149 grondige insig in die betekenisvolle generiese kurrikulumfaktore wat leerderprestasie be\u00efnvloed. Dit vereis ingryping in die grondslagfase om laerskoolleerders vir ho\u00ebrskool en uiteindelik Graad 12 gereed te kry. Op grond van hierdie bevindings kan die Departement van Basiese Onderwys veranderings aanbring wat die prestasie van leerders kan verbeter.\r\nDie studie beveel aan dat soveel ervare onderwysers as moontlik by die kurrikulumontwerp betrek word. Dit sal leerdersprestasie verbeter. Daar word voorts aanbeveel dat die Departement van Basiese Onderwys die aantal ho\u00ebrskoolvakke verminder; die tydperk waarin die sillabus afgehandel word, met die jaarlikse onderrigplan in ooreenstemming bring;\r\nvii\r\nskoolassessering met toetse vervang; leerders aan die einde van elke fase \u0149 uitgangseksamen laat skryf; een handboek vir elke vak voorskryf; skrander studente aanmoedig om onderwysers te word; en die aansien van die onderwysberoep verhoog. Ervare onderwysers moet aan die opstel van die kurrikulum meewerk omdat hulle die struikelblokke in die onderwysstelsel die beste begryp. Die Departement van Basiese Onderwys moet minder aan die kurrikulum torring aangesien onderwysers beter werk met dinge wat hulle ken.\r\nDie slotsom waartoe in hierdie studie gekom word, is dat die eerste 30 minute van elke skooldag \u0149 Engelse periode moet wees waarin leerders hulle leesvaardighede verbeter. Leerders moet reeds in Graad 8 vakke kan kies, nie eers in Graad 10 nie. Die slaagpunt moet in alle vakke 50% wees. Lewensori\u00ebntering moet slegs tot Graad 7 aangebied word. Leerders wat nie in \u0149 hoofstroomskool die mas opkom nie, moet aan kolleges vir verdere onderwys en opleiding verder kan leer. Punte moenie opgeskuif word nie. Meer onderwyseropleidingskolleges moet geopen word. Skole met beperkte hulpbronne moet van meer en beter hulpmiddels voorsien word. \u0149 Voltydse sielkundige moet by elke skool aangestel word, en suksesvolle en opgevoede gemeenskapslede moet leerders gereeld motiveer.Kaonafat\u0161o ya ma\u0161omelo a Kreite ya 12 ke ntlha ya bohlokwa ka ge baithuti ba mmalwa ba kgona go ya yunibesithi.

The study also discusses data protection law as the protection of the rights to privacy and identity are interlinked with data protection in that data protection assumes importance when there is processing of personal information on SNSs.\r\nThe study seeks to determine whether South African law provides adequate protection for the interests that form the object of these personality rights, and highlights certain shortcomings, particularly in the context of SNSs. It also suggests solutions where there are shortcomings by learning from other jurisdictions. Related issues investigated are: who should be held responsible for the user-generated content uploaded on SNSs; the role of the Internet Service Provider (ISP); and how to deal with anonymous defendants.Private LawLL.

		"title": "Efficient Multi-robot Exploration via Multi-head Attention-based\n  Cooperation Strategy",
		"description": "The goal of coordinated multi-robot exploration tasks is to employ a team of\nautonomous robots to explore an unknown environment as quickly as possible.\nCompared with human-designed methods, which began with heuristic and rule-based\napproaches, learning-based methods enable individual robots to learn\nsophisticated and hard-to-design cooperation strategies through deep\nreinforcement learning technologies. However, in decentralized multi-robot\nexploration tasks, learning-based algorithms are still far from being\nuniversally applicable to the continuous space due to the difficulties\nassociated with area calculation and reward function designing; moreover,\nexisting learning-based methods encounter problems when attempting to balance\nthe historical trajectory issue and target area conflict problem. Furthermore,\nthe scalability of these methods to a large number of agents is poor because of\nthe exponential explosion problem of state space. Accordingly, this paper\nproposes a novel approach - Multi-head Attention-based Multi-robot Exploration\nin Continuous Space (MAMECS) - aimed at reducing the state space and\nautomatically learning the cooperation strategies required for decentralized\nmulti-robot exploration tasks in continuous space. Computational geometry\nknowledge is applied to describe the environment in continuous space and to\ndesign an improved reward function to ensure a superior exploration rate.\nMoreover, the multi-head attention mechanism employed helps to solve the\nhistorical trajectory issue in the decentralized multi-robot exploration task,\nas well as to reduce the quadratic increase of action space",

		"description": "The concept of creativity is ubiquitous in educational reports, policies, and curricula in the minority world. Many of these texts consider creativity an economic imperative and a key element of change for every knowledge domain of the 21st century. This study is anchored in a Critical Discourse Analysis theoretical framework and represents an inquiry of creativity in kindergarten curricula. The aims of this inquiry were to identify creativity common sense beliefs and theories and to examine which ones have been employed in which curricula, and with what implications for children, teachers, educators, and society. I designed a qualitative case study (Stake, 2005) consisting of participant observations, field notes, and interviews from one Ontario kindergarten class for one cycle of activity in the fall of 2012, which demonstrated the operational curriculum. I also conducted a critical discourse analysis (CDA) (Weiss & Wodak, 2003) of texts used in the kindergarten classroom, or required to be used, by teachers, early childhood educators (ECEs), and principals or coordinators of programs. These texts included the draft version of the programmatic kindergarten curriculum (Ontario Ministry of Education [OME], 2010) and the final version (Ontario Ministry of Education, 2016). Further, as a counterpoint, I analysed texts from Reggio Emilia\u2019s early childhood education curriculum, as identified by teachers, to contrast and illustrate ethical pedagogical possibilities. The findings resulted from the ethical comparison of the studied educational paradigms were categorized in terms of enablers and constrainers of creativity. The emergent paradigm of creativity specific to Reggio Emilia, which draws on multiple theories while using ethics as gatekeeper, is the most beneficent for children and the system. The constraints of creativity as illustrated by the analysis of the Ontario programmatic and operational curriculum are sourced in the neoliberal discourse in education, in the accountability for efficiency\u2019s sake, in creativity promoted and standardized in areas of learning, which will be of use in the future working age of the child, in transforming teachers and ECEs as managers, accountants, and grade one pre-trainers, and students in objects of political will and desire",

In this study school violence was defined as (a) individual victimization experiences (Furlong, Chung, Bates & Morrison, 1995), (b) gang activities and weapon possession (Kingerly, Puritt, & Heuberger, 1985), (c) illegal substance abuse (Furlong, Casas, Corral, Chung, & Bates, 1997), (d) bullying (Morrison, 2009), and (e) conflict and crisis management (Nickerson & Brock, 2011, Gorton & Alston, 2009).  The central research question was: How do first through fifth year (U.S. sixth through 12th grade) teachers in four different government-owned schools in Barbados describe their experiences with school violence, school climate, and school safety?  The theory guiding this study was Urie Bronfenbrenner\u2019s (1977) ecological systems theory as it explained the multilayered and multifaceted phenomenon of school violence.  A total of 16 participants were selected using the criterion sampling (Creswell, 2013).  Documentation, individual interviews, and focus groups were used as data collection tools (Patton, 1990).  A combination of Moustakas (1994) and Saldana (2013) data analysis methods were employed in this research study.  A total of ten sub-themes were identified in this study.  Five sub-themes that describe how teacher participants in four different government-owned schools in Barbados described school climate and school safety; three sub-themes described what ecological factors teacher participants perceived needed to be developed, to help improve the school climate and create safer school environments, and two sub-themes revealed what ecological factors were developed, to help reduce school with a view of improving school safety",

		"title": "Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP)",
		"description": "In this paper, the concept of environmental indicator is reviewed as a relevant element used in the environmental management of any organisation. The importance of this element within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise the relevance of using indicators, they do not specify any methodology to identify which indicators have to be implemented. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already implemented performance indicators, most of them do not mention the method applied to obtain the indicators. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports to identify indicators may not necessarily be science-based or systematic in approach. For these reasons, the need to develop a new methodology able to identify the ports' most adequate indicators was detected. Therefore, a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP) was developed. It aims at identifying performance indicators in ports and providing guidelines for their proper implementation. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat/teip) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly and practical as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user. This new methodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. TEIP aims at helping port managers at easily determining their significant port indicators, which provides valuable elements for the decision-making processes.Peer Reviewe",

		"description": "The purpose of this thesis is to explore how education in one girls\u2019 government school teaches understandings of citizenship and to identify potential links to the reproduction of identity-based violence in Pakistan. This in-depth qualitative case study was conducted in a girls\u2019 government model school. This study focuses on curriculum and school practices of the secondary school section. Data was collected through interviews with staff, a participatory workshop with teachers, focus groups with students, classroom observation, and informal discussions. I also analyzed the Pakistan Studies textbook used in the secondary section of the school.\n\n\n\nUsing theories of critical education, intersectionality, and Galtung\u2019s violence triangle, I argue that despite recent political and curricular reform attempts, education in Pakistan reproduces a homogeneous concept of a legitimate citizen (male Sunni Muslim). While this evolved to unite an ethnically diverse Pakistan, it has contributed to identity-based violence (direct, structural, and cultural) against those that do not fit within this conception.\n\n\n\nIn this school, the Pakistan Studies textbooks create an official discourse that promotes this gendered and exclusionary citizenship. I show how the Pakistan studies textbook uses history and constitutional lessons to promote citizenship that is based in a masculine Islam meant to oppose the Hindu \u2018other\u2019 as well as to promote the exclusion of women and minorities from full citizenship. I also found that teachers own understandings of citizenship, which closely reflect the text, are deeply rooted in their understanding of their notions of the ideal Muslim woman. I find that the school rewards gendered behavior in both students and teachers. I then explore the extent to which the school reproduces other social divisions including religious, ethnicity, and class. I find that the school simultaneously reproduces, mitigates, and exacerbates these tensions. I then argue that the teachers\u2019 and students\u2019 understandings of the role of women to counter violence is rooted in the notions of middle class women\u2019s roles as mothers and supporters of men that are reproduced through school practice.\n\n\n\nThis study furthers the knowledge on the links between education and violence by showing that promoting a homogeneous ideal of a citizen through education, while intended as a nation building project, can contribute to structural, cultural and direct violence against women and minorities, limiting their agency to engage in social transformation",

		"description": "This research study was designed to find out the role of community participation in Socio-economic development through secondary education in one of the remotest regions in Pakistan. The objectives of study were to investigate to what extent the community is involved in dissemination of secondary education in public sector, to find out the benefits of community involvement in secondary education, to unpack the issues and challenges faced by teachers due to lack of community participation and to stumble on the character of education in socio-economic development of Baltistan region. Researcher used stratified sampling technique. There are six tehsils in district Skardus i.e. Skardu, Gamba Skardu, Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar and Rondu. To give representation to wide spread geographic region of the Skardu District, these Tehsils were divided into two groups. The group 1 was comprised of Skardu, Gamba Skardu and Roundu while the remaining three Tehsils (Gultari, Kharmang, Shigar) were put into group 2. Seventeen institutions were taken as sample of the study from six Tehsils of the Skardu District formed 44.7% of available 38 Public Sector Secondary Schools in Skardu. Two teachers and the head teacher were contacted for the purpose of data collection from each sample school. Opinion of 13 community notables was also sought through structured interview. The data were analyzed by using descriptive and inferential statistics, chi square and percentage methods. On the basis of findings it was concluded that majority teachers and head teachers of secondary schools viewed that the community participation is necessary part of education, majority of teachers, head teachers and community notables viewed that the main reasons of lack of community / parents participation are illiteracy, unawareness and busy life due to economic pressure, all respondents\u2019 teachers, head teachers and community notables have supported the statement that the parent\u2019s active participation can enhance the student\u2019s achievements, and all respondent have responded that Education plays a vital role in socio-economic development of the society. The recommendations of the study included that there is great need to make aware the parents about the importance of their participation in child\u2019s educational achievement, raise awareness about the relation between school and community, repeated contacts and meetings with the SMC members, conduct of seminars, workshops can play a vital role for the development of community participation in education, community members can invite in co-curricular activities like Parent\u2019s days, cleanliness weeks, and prize distribution ceremonies and national and Islamic events, there may be a counseling center in school where counseling of students may be conducted and parents and community members may also be invite, through community involvement it can be possible to make more and more registration of children in the school, and\u00a0 media both print and electronic is also an effective source through which community can be motivated to participate in education",

		"title": "Does IEB make the grade? Alternative testing methods and educational outcomes: The case of the IEB in South Africa",
		"description": "According to the Independent Examinations Board (IEB, 2015), students who write the IEB National Senior Certificate school-leaving exam are at a distinct advantage and seem to be better prepared for the pressures and challenges faced during their university years than are those students who wrote the Department of Basic Education (DBE) exams. Although the underlying curriculum is no different, the IEB exam is thought to be more challenging and to encourage more critical thinking and deeper engagement with the material than the DBE exam. Thus, this research paper aims to provide a rigorous investigation of whether those students who write the IEB exam at the end of their matric year achieve higher university grades in their first year of study, as well as a decomposition of this effect into a teaching effect and a testing effect. This is done by exploiting within-school variation of examination boards. Given that studies investigating independent school impacts on university performance have predominantly been conducted internationally (McNabb et al., 2002; Ogg et al., 2009; Smith &amp; Naylor, 2001; Smith &amp; Naylor, 2005), this paper will add to the literature in the South African context. By using the techniques of OLS, quantile regression, binary choice probit models and ordered probit models, this paper attempts to provide a holistic view of the effect that the IEB school-leaving examination has on a student\u2019s academic performance at a tertiary level. The data used in this study is also unique, in that it is made up of an amalgamation of student record data obtained from the University of Cape Town (UCT), as well as governmental survey data. This paper finds that the IEB examination has a strong positive effect of between 1.6 and 6.5 percentage points on first-year GPA at UCT, particularly in the Medicine and Engineering faculties. Furthermore, this effect is present, but decreasing across the entirety of the performance distribution. Students with an IEB matric are significantly more likely to achieve a 2nd class pass or higher at the end of their first year of study than are comparable students from Former African schools. When decomposing the IEB effect into a teaching effect and a testing effect, it was found that the majority of the impact of the IEB comes simply from the different exam, and that teaching effects are minimal. A further finding of interest is that the IEB effect seems to be independent of resource availability, and that simply the exposure to the alternative testing method is sufficient for students to see significant improvements in their university performance. These results are robust to changes in functional form, and provide a strong and clear picture that perhaps South Africa should be adopting more of the IEB policies towards teaching and learning on a national scale",

		"description": "Neural network-based approaches have become the driven forces for Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks. Conventionally, there are two mainstream\nneural architectures for NLP tasks: the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the\nconvolution neural network (ConvNet). RNNs are good at modeling long-term\ndependencies over input texts, but preclude parallel computation. ConvNets do\nnot have memory capability and it has to model sequential data as un-ordered\nfeatures. Therefore, ConvNets fail to learn sequential dependencies over the\ninput texts, but it is able to carry out high-efficient parallel computation.\nAs each neural architecture, such as RNN and ConvNets, has its own pro and con,\nintegration of different architectures is assumed to be able to enrich the\nsemantic representation of texts, thus enhance the performance of NLP tasks.\nHowever, few investigation explores the reconciliation of these seemingly\nincompatible architectures. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid\narchitecture based on a novel hierarchical multi-granularity attention\nmechanism, named Multi-granularity Attention-based Hybrid Neural Network\n(MahNN). The attention mechanism is to assign different weights to different\nparts of the input sequence to increase the computation efficiency and\nperformance of neural models. In MahNN, two types of attentions are introduced:\nthe syntactical attention and the semantical attention. The syntactical\nattention computes the importance of the syntactic elements (such as words or\nsentence) at the lower symbolic level and the semantical attention is used to\ncompute the importance of the embedded space dimension corresponding to the\nupper latent semantics. We adopt the text classification as an exemplifying way\nto illustrate the ability of MahNN to understand texts",

		"description": "Rolling bearings are widely used in rotating machinery and their fault is one of the most common causes of industrial machinery failure. Damage identification of roller bearings has been deeply developed to detect faults using vibration-based signal processing. There exist different signal processing techniques to decompose a signal and extract informative features such as EMD and Wavelet transform. EMD is a method for decomposing a multi- component signal into several elementary Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and has been widely applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machines. However, there are some drawbacks such as stopping criterion for sifting process, mode mixing and border effect problem. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a newly developed noise assisted method to solve mode mixing problem exists in empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. Since the white noise is added throughout the entire signal decomposition process, mode mixing is effectively eliminated. However, there is still a great challenge: identifying two effective parameters (the amplitude of added noise and the number of ensemble trials) which may affect the performance of EEMD. Using low amplitude (relative to the signal), mode mixing cannot be prevented. On the other hand, too large amplitude achieves some redundant IMFs. Although some algorithm or values have been proposed, there is no robust guide to select optimal amplitude yet, especially for early damage detection (very small defects). In this study a reliable method is investigated to determine suitable amplitude and numerous real vibration signals (various operating conditions and two damage locations) are analysed to verify effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Vibration signals for healthy and defective bearings were acquired using the test rig assembled by Dynamics & Identification Research Group (DIRG) at Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Politecnico di Torino",

		"description": "There continues to be strong interest among established, experienced academic users of 3D virtual environments for their sustained educational use. Consistent with global trends, they plan to further develop and optimise existing applications, reuse skills and experiences gained to develop new applications, and to share and reuse existing virtual resources. This is against a background of varied support from institutions, colleagues, students, funding bodies and also changing understanding and awareness of virtual environments and virtual reality by the general community as a result of consumer developments such as the popularity of multi-user online role playing amongst both children and adults, and the acquisition of technologies by companies with deeply entrenched technologies. At the same time, the ongoing development and availability of new multiuser virtual environment platforms, associated peripherals and virtual reality technologies promise new and exciting opportunities for educators to collaborate with researchers on a global scale, while also exploring the affordances of these technologies for enhancing the learning outcomes for an increasingly diverse and distributed student population",

A sample of 11 primary/elementary teachers from Newfoundland and Labrador English Schools District (NLESD) participated in this study. The results of this study revealed that the participants perceive robotics to have the potential to facilitate learning of primary/elementary science and technology-related topics, while they do not perceive robotics to be a useful tool for learning mathematics. The participants also perceived robotics to have positive effects on students\u2019 lifelong learning skills. Furthermore, the participants indicated a number of barriers to integrate robotics into their teaching activities and expressed the supports that they need",

In the past, the spatial data was stored in analogue documents and different maps, but today it is stored digitally. Municipal administrations use web-based GIS-aplications when working with spatial data. With the development of the new technological approach, named cloud computing, the execution of these systems has become cheaper, and above all, simpler. GIS have a typical client\u2013server model. Various architecture of client-server models are described. Cloud computing is divided into public, private and hybrid clouds. The business model is divided into three layers: infrastructure as service, platform as service and software as service. Practically predominating in the field of GIS-technology and the Internet are the industrial open standards, which are described in detail. Described is also the following free software: MapServer, PostgreSQL, PostGIS and the three most frequently used free programming licences: GPL, LGPL and MIT. The chapter Internet protocols, web standards and recommendations describes the recommendations and standards of the World Wide Web Consortium that are applied to the basic web entities, like data formats, scripting language, protocols, objects, cookies and others. In the end we compare the web GIS-solutions that are used by Slovene municipal administrations. We compared the criteria and we determine the best available system",

		"title": "Fault diagnosis of roller bearings using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and support vector machine (SVM)",
		"description": "Rolling bearings are widely used in rotating machinery and their fault is one of the most common causes of industrial machinery failure. Damage identification of roller bearings has been deeply developed to detect faults using vibration-based signal processing. There exist different signal processing techniques to decompose a signal and extract informative features such as EMD and Wavelet transform. EMD is a method for decomposing a multi- component signal into several elementary Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and has been widely applied to fault diagnosis of rotating machines. However, there are some drawbacks such as stopping criterion for sifting process, mode mixing and border effect problem. Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a newly developed noise assisted method to solve mode mixing problem exists in empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method. Since the white noise is added throughout the entire signal decomposition process, mode mixing is effectively eliminated. However, there is still a great challenge: identifying two effective parameters (the amplitude of added noise and the number of ensemble trials) which may affect the performance of EEMD. Using low amplitude (relative to the signal), mode mixing cannot be prevented. On the other hand, too large amplitude achieves some redundant IMFs. Although some algorithm or values have been proposed, there is no robust guide to select optimal amplitude yet, especially for early damage detection (very small defects). In this study a reliable method is investigated to determine suitable amplitude and numerous real vibration signals (various operating conditions and two damage locations) are analysed to verify effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Vibration signals for healthy and defective bearings were acquired using the test rig assembled by Dynamics & Identification Research Group (DIRG) at Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Politecnico di Torino",

		"description": "The objective of this research is to improve the speaking skill of Class VIII E students at SMP Negeri 2 Kalasan in the academic year of 2011/2012. The study attempted to be one of the efforts to solve the problems related to the students\u2019 speaking skill by using conversational videos.\n\nThe type of this research was action research. The steps of this research were reconnaissance, planning, conducting action and observation, and reflection. The participants of the research were the researcher, the English teacher, and the students of Class VIII E of SMP Negeri 2 Kalasan. There were two forms of the data in this study, namely qualitative and quantitative data. The qualitative data were obtained through conducting observation, in depth-interview with the students and the English teacher, making field notes, taking photographs to the teaching and learning process, and holding the discussion with the English teacher as a collaborator. Meanwhile, the quantitative data were obtained from the scoring of the students\u2019 performance in each cycle. In addition, the validity of the data was obtained through democratic validity, outcome validity, catalitic validity, dialog validity and process validity. Then, the reliability of the data was obtained by giving the genuine data, such as field notes, interview transcripts, photographs and observation checklist.\n\nThe results of the research showed that there were some improvements in students\u2019 speaking skill including pronunciation, vocabulary, fluency and comprehension. The improvements could be seen from the students\u2019 speaking performance during the implementation. The improvements were also supported by the progress of the average scores in Cycle 1 scoring and Cycle 2 scoring. Then, there were some students\u2019 positive behaviours toward the implementation of the conversational videos related to their participation in the class. They were more active than before in every activity, they actively participated in doing group discussion and role play. Also, the students were motivated to speak and to actively take part on the conversation. Conversational videos grabbed the students\u2019attention by providing the language used that could be seen and heard at once, so that their motivation was improved. Thus, the implementation of conversational videos could improve the students\u2019 speaking skill",

		"title": "Redefining learning environments in conflict areas : a Palestinian case study",
		"description": "Thesis (S.M. in Architecture Studies)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 2013.This electronic version was submitted by the student author.  The certified thesis is available in the Institute Archives and Special Collections.Cataloged from student-submitted PDF version of thesis.Includes bibliographical references (p. 168-173).This thesis is an exploration of learning environments in the West Bank of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) as administered by private, refugee and public school systems. In considering the insularity of learning environments in the OPT, this thesis finds that despite increased school construction since 1994, public and refugee student drop-out rates have increased, enrollment rates have decreased, academic achievement is low, and students suffer from stress. It is hypothesized that if schools are conceptualized as part of a broader learning environment, then the socio-spatial issues impacting student success may be improved. To test this hypothesis, learning environments in the OPT are examined with a two-fold methodology: historical and architectural. The two-fold analysis utilizes a conceptual framework, where child, building, neighborhood context, and education system, are understood as the four components of a learning environment. The historical analysis is framed from the Late-Ottoman era until today and follows changing theories of education in parallel with the changing relationship between schools and the socio-spatial reality of the conflict. Results from the historical analysis indicate that educational institutions often cannot operate during times of crisis, leading local family and teacher networks to develop informal education systems in unconventional spaces. It is determined that learning environments must be able to adapt to the conflict and must embrace local communities as architectural, spatial, and social resources. This finding serves as a critical foundation for the architectural analysis. The architectural analysis uses data collected from field work at 24 schools in the West Bank in August of 2012 through informal interviews with locals, photography, and journaling. The data reveal that the socio-spatial contexts of each school are unique due in part to divisions of the land. In order to limit the number of variables, special focus was given to three schools in Ramallah, which is a unique enclave that encompasses within it the socio-spatial realities of other enclaves in the West Bank. Taking from the lessons of each school system, it is concluded that new learning environments in the Occupied Palestinian Territories must positively respond to the bleak structures of the occupation by becoming programmatically diverse, architecturally innovative, and spatially integrated in order to create new and less insular cultural centers of which the students and communities can be proud. This thesis concludes with recommendations for educationalists, architects and development professionals that stem from revelations in the historical analysis and results from the architectural analysis. Learning environments must span outwards allowing for an expansion of school resources, a broadening of learning experiences for youth, and the unification of Palestinians in order to improve the socio-spatial disorder of the occupation.by Jenine Kotob.S.M.in Architecture Studie",

		"title": "The Educational Resilience of Children in Urban Squatter Settlements of Kathmandu",
		"description": "Nepal is a partner to the international commitment to achieve the goals of Education for All (EFA) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Efforts have been made through the EFA National Plan of Action 2003-2015 and School Sector Reform Program (SSRP) to achieve the EFA goals and the MDGs. Over the last few years, Nepal has demonstrated progress in some of the indicators related to children s participation in school. The Department of Education (2012) has reported that the primary education Net Enrolment Rate (NER), Grade 1 Net Intake Rate (NIR), Grade 5 Survival Rate (SR), and Dropout Rate (DR), are 95.3, 91.2, 84.1, and 5.2 percent respectively. However, it will be difficult to close the bigger gaps of 4.7, 8.8, 15.9, and 5.2 percent of the NER, NIR, SR, and DR respectively by 2015. The challenge lies in the large number of school-aged children who do not attend formal primary schooling. Likewise, a significant number of students repeat grades and those promoted may have low achievement. Realizing this bleak educational scenario, Nepal has been focusing more on access to quality education for the children of economically marginalized people through equity measures (scholarships and incentives). These children belong to the poorest groups (Wagley, September 2013, The Himalayan Times), such as the disadvantaged and the deprived communities of urban squatter settlements. Many reasons have been identified for the phenomenon of out-of-school children, including poor family economic conditions, an unfavorable school environment, socio-cultural beliefs and traditions, parents not recognizing the importance of education, inaccessible schools for children with disabilities, parents unwillingness, corporal punishment and children s domestic responsibilities (Scheuermann 2013). Other factors listed as contributing to primary level dropout are violence in school such as corporal punishment by teachers (Nepal, DoE 2010), children s domestic responsibilities, and an unfavorable school environment (Nepal, DoE 2012). In this context, in particular, children in urban squatter settlements face more severe adversities and risks as most are deprived of government services because of a lack of official national identification",

		"description": "Since Namibia gained independence parents have increasingly been seen as equal partners in the education process. The Education Act 16 of 2001 provides for the democratic participation in schools by parents, learners and other education stakeholders through the introduction of regional Education Forums and School Boards in schools Parental involvement in school governance has been widely researched and has become a \u2018hot topic\u2019 worldwide, including in Namibia. This study investigated and described parental involvement through the School Board in school governance in a secondary school in Otjozondjupa region, Namibia. The study was conducted within a qualitative, interpretive paradigm. The study employed three data collection tools namely, semi-structured interviews, document analysis and observation. The School Board was made up of parents of different classes and backgrounds, i.e. employed, unemployed, professionals and business persons and with different levels of educational background. These members create a network that represents the voices of parents from different social groups, with different levels of social capital. The different levels of social capital shape the nature of the contributions and interactions on the Board. The study found that in spite of the frequency of interaction between the School Board, parents and the community the School Board is still in a dilemma as it is unable to connect with its prominent source of potential support, such as the business community, due to an outdated view that the school is well-off based on its historic status of privilege. With respect to communications with parents the focus tends to be on the negatives of learners\u2019 behaviour or performance and the task of the parents in this regard. Broadening the agenda of the collaboration to include positive aspects of the child would add to the motivation of parents and open possibilities for new forms of collaboration. The school lacks a well-coordinated system for utilizing the available resources as well as community expertise for the benefit of the school. On the strength of the findings, one of the recommendations is for a more structured program and strategy for the Boards various interactions with the community and parents",

		"title": "Teacher educators' perceptions about possibilities and challenges of the merger between Namibian Higher Education institutions for improving teacher education",
		"description": "Philosophiae Doctor - PhDThe purpose of this study was to explore the perceptions of the teacher educators about the merger between the University of Namibia and Namibia\u2019s former Colleges of Education with regards to the merger's capacity to improve quality teacher education. The focus of the study differed from the various merger studies in that theirs has mainly been on technical issues of mergers to interpret merger capacity to improve change. Of importance about this focus is that the views of teacher educators were deemed important because of their 'agency' in the merger and its capacity to improve teacher education quality. The grounded theory of Strauss and Corbin of 1998 framed the study. The key question of the study was: \"what are the perceptions of teacher educators about the merger of the former colleges of education with the University of Namibia's and the capacity to improve teacher education quality in the country?\" A case study methodology was employed in which semi-structured questions were used to collect data. In addition, the study also employed observations and document analysis as sources of data.The key finding of the study was that all the participants' perceptions were that the merger has the capacity to improve the quality of teacher education in Namibia. The core of this finding serves as evidence of the complexities of mergers, particularly in terms of how participants perceive the merger's capability of improving quality. Firstly, the perceptions related to the contexts in which the participant teacher educators found themselves. Furthermore, the perceptions appeared to be associated with various contextual needs experienced by participants in the various institutions. The study analysis further suggested that the needs related to issues associated with input, process and output. These findings laid the ground for an emergent theory for understanding of teacher educators\u2019 perceptions about the mergers. A conclusion drawn from the above findings were that the Maslow Hierarchy of Need Theory (with its biological/physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness and love, esteem needs, and self-actualization) provide better understanding of perceptions about mergers",

		"title": "An Investigation into English as a Second Language (ESL) Learner Participation in Language Learning Opportunities:  A Social View",
		"description": "Learner participation in language learning opportunities has been configured differently by different learning theories. In the domain of Second Language Acquisition (SLA), the cognitive view of learning has been dominant in explaining learner participation. It has been widely accepted that it should be in the form of participation in oral activities which leads to gains in linguistic competence. The aim of this thesis is to understand the issue of learner participation from the social perspective, where a broader understanding of learning will be employed informed by the work of Lave and Wenger (1991) and others. To do so, this study investigates the forms of participation of six ESL learners in suburban Malaysia in two contexts: in-class and out-of-class. \n\nIn order to understand the issue of learner participation from a social view point, data were collected using classroom observations, learners\u2019 interviews, learner diaries, and photographs taken by them. All the data were transcribed and analysed qualitatively. In order to handle the large amount of data, the Nvivo software package was used for organisation and retrieval purposes.\n\nThe findings reveal several insights about learner participation. First, learners are active agents where they constantly make decisions on what to engage with and how, and act on the norms and expectations that are imposed on them in a particular sociocultural context. Second, the six learners are members of or aspired to become members of several communities: academically successful learners; successful ESL learners; proficient speakers of the target language; the classroom; and youth. Thus, they aligned their forms of participation with these various communities. Third, learners in this study tended to distinguish between learning and other kinds of engagement. They tended to equate certain forms of participation as actions that one needed to take to learn the language; thus other forms of participation accorded less value. \n\nIn this study, some insights from Communities of Practice (CoP) theory- learning as a process of gaining membership in a particular community and that learners move from peripheral to core membership- were used to understand the issue of learner participation. However, upon understanding and interpreting the data, it was found that CoP theory is limited in several ways. First, CoP focuses only on one type of community (e.g. the classroom) in one temporal dimension. Yet, findings indicate that there are several other communities that exist in the classroom at one time. Due to this shortcoming, this study has turned to the concept of \u2018figured worlds\u2019 (Holland et al, 2001). Secondly, CoP theory argues for a group dynamic. Less recognition is given to the fact that individual learners are also dynamic and agentive. Akkerman and Meijer (2011) suggest dialogical views on identity; in which a framework is provided that acknowledges the multiple, discontinuous and social nature of identity (a postmodern view), while at the same time assumes identity as being unitary, continuous and individual (a modern view). Thirdly, CoP tends to focus on a singular \u201cidentity-in-practice (Tan and Barton (2008). Tan and Barton (ibid: 50) argue for the plurality of identities-in-practice (IdPs); rather than a singular \u201cidentity-in-practice (IdP) as suggested by Lave and Wenger (1991).\n\nThe view of learning as boundary crossing seems to better describe the kinds of participation and learning that have been suggested by the findings generated in the study. Instead of looking at learning as participation in a particular community, learning as boundary crossing better captures the dynamic of learner participation in language learning opportunities, of learners as whole persons (rather than fragmented identities), and of learners as agentive beings.Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysi",

These scores are useful for personalized search and recommendations on\nnetworks including social networks, user-item networks, and the web. Past work\nhas proposed using Monte Carlo or using linear algebra to estimate scores from\na single source to every target, making them inefficient for a single pair. Our\ncontribution is a new bidirectional algorithm which combines linear algebra and\nMonte Carlo to achieve significant speed improvements. On a diverse set of six\ngraphs, our algorithm is 70x faster than past state-of-the-art algorithms. We\nalso present theoretical analysis: while past algorithms require $\\Omega(n)$\ntime to estimate a random walk score of typical size $\\frac{1}{n}$ on an\n$n$-node graph to a given constant accuracy, our algorithm requires only\n$O(\\sqrt{m})$ expected time for an average target, where $m$ is the number of\nedges, and is provably accurate.\n  In addition to our core bidirectional estimator for personalized PageRank, we\npresent an alternative algorithm for undirected graphs, a generalization to\narbitrary walk lengths and Markov Chains, an algorithm for personalized search\nranking, and an algorithm for sampling random paths from a given source to a\ngiven set of targets.

		"description": "I denne oppgaven ville vi bidra til \u00e5 sette lys p\u00e5 utdanningens betydning for ut\u00f8velse av HR hos personalledere i IT-bransjen. Etter gjennomf\u00f8rt Bachelor i HR og Personalledelse ser vi for oss at mye av kunnskapen vi har f\u00e5tt kan v\u00e6re nyttig i arbeidslivet i ledelse av menneskelige ressurser. Dette ledet oss til en hypotese om at personalledere i IT-bransjen med lederutdanning ser st\u00f8rre hensikt med strategisk utf\u00f8relse av HR-aktiviteter enn de uten. Derav kommer problemstillingen for oppgaven: \u201cHva betyr utdanningsbakgrunn for personallederes utf\u00f8relse av HR-aktiviteter i norske IT-bedrifter?\u201d Oppgaven tar for seg den enkelte leders tiln\u00e6rming til personallederrollen og HR-aktivitetene. Vi har benyttet kvalitativ metode fordi vi \u00f8nsket \u00e5 f\u00e5 en dypere forst\u00e5else rundt temaet og finne bakenforliggende m\u00f8nstre og \u00e5rsaker til hva som p\u00e5virker HR-arbeidet og betydningen av utdanningsbakgrunn. V\u00e5rt teoretiske rammeverk er basert p\u00e5 teorier og forskning p\u00e5 HR og personalledelse, herunder HR-aktiviteter, strategisk ledelse og lederatferd, noe som har v\u00e6rt grunnlaget i utarbeidelsen av v\u00e5r intervjuguide og for \u00e5 svare p\u00e5 problemstillingen. Funnene i v\u00e5rt utvalg viser at utdanningsbakgrunn har betydning for utf\u00f8relsen av noen HR-aktiviteter, s\u00e6rlig kompetanseutvikling og medarbeidersamtaler, der ledere med lederutdanning har en mer strukturert tiln\u00e6rming til disse enn ledere med fagutdanning eller mindre lederutdanning. I tillegg fant vi at ledere med lederutdanning har st\u00f8rre fokus p\u00e5 bruk av verdier i forbindelse med lederstrategi og har st\u00f8rre kunnskap om betydningen av indre motivasjon. Fagkompetanse og lederkompetanse er i stor grad komplement\u00e6re. I tunge fagmilj\u00f8er er sterk IT-kunnskap n\u00e6rmest forventet av en leder. Imidlertid kan lederutdanning ses p\u00e5 som en indikasjon p\u00e5 lederens interesse for ledelse som fagfelt. Ledere i v\u00e5rt utvalg med lederutdanning er i st\u00f8rre grad opptatt av det organisatoriske. Ledere med mindre formell lederkompetanse er mer opptatt av det faglige og mindre innstilt p\u00e5 \u00e5 ta p\u00e5 seg flere personaloppgaver. Samtidig er lederskap noe som er uavhengig av utdanningsbakgrunn. Erfaringer fra \u00e5 ta ledelse i og utenfor arbeidet er noe som kan gi uformelt l\u00e6ringsutbytte og kan v\u00e6re en p\u00e5virkende faktor til ledertiln\u00e6rming. Andre variabler som organisasjonens st\u00f8rrelse, organisasjonssystemer og sentralisert HR-avdeling kan ogs\u00e5 ha p\u00e5virkende effekt p\u00e5 hvordan HR-arbeidet blir utf\u00f8rt i hver enkelt bedrift. Vi vil derfor ikke si noe om hva slags effekt variasjoner i personalledernes utf\u00f8relse av HR har p\u00e5 de ansatte",

		"title": "Shard Selection in Distributed Collaborative Search Engines A design, implementation and evaluation of shard selection in ElasticSearch",
		"description": "To increase their scalability and reliability many search engines today are distributed\nsystems. In a distributed search engine several nodes collaborate in handling the search\noperations. Usually each node is only responsible for one or a few parts of the index\nused for storing and searching. These smaller index parts are usually referred to as\nshards.\nLately ElasticSearch has emerged as a popular distributed search engine intended for\nmedium- and large scale searching. An ElasticSearch cluster could potentially consist of\na lot of nodes and shards. Sending a search query to all nodes and shards might result\nin high latency when the size of the cluster is large or when the nodes are far apart\nfrom each other. ElasticSearch provides some features for limiting the number of nodes\nwhich participate in each search query in special cases, but generally each query will be\nprocessed by all nodes and shards.\nShard selection is a method used to only forward queries to the shards which are estimated\nto be highly relevant to a query. In this thesis a shard selection plugin called\nSAFE has been developed for ElasticSearch. SAFE implements four state of the art\nshard selection algorithms and supports all current query types in ElasticSearch. The\npurpose of SAFE is to further increase the scalability of ElasticSearch by limiting the\nnumber of nodes which participate in each search query. The cost of using the plugin is\nthat there might be a negative e ect on the search results.\nThe purpose of this thesis has been to evaluate to which extent SAFE a ects the search\nresults in ElasticSearch. The four implemented algorithms have been compared in three\ndi erent experiments using two di erent data sets. Two new metrics called Pk@N and\nModi ed Recall have been developed for this thesis which measures the relative performance\nbetween exhaustive search and shard selection in a search engine like Elastic-\nSearch.\nThe results indicate that three algorithms in SAFE perform very well when documents\nare distributed to shards depending on which linguistic topic they belong to. However if\ndocuments are randomly allocated to shards, which is the standard approach in Elastic-\nSearch, then SAFE does not show any signi cant results and seems to be unusable.\nThis thesis shows that if a suitable document distribution policy is used and there is a\ntolerance for losing some relevant documents in the search results then a shard selection\nimplementations like SAFE could be used to further increase the scalability of a\ndistributed search engine, especially in a low resource environment",

		"description": "The aim of the study was to compare the effects of the use of interactive computer simulations for cognitive load change of grade 11 learners in the acquisition of knowledge and a science process skill in geometrical optics. Both the use of computer simulations and traditional teaching was teacher centred. The study was done in a rural area in South Africa, in the Limpopo Province in the district of Vhembe. The theoretical framework was based on the information processing model. Within the non-equivalent quasi experimental design a switching replications design study was used whereby 105 learners in four schools took part. This study found that in terms of the acquisition of knowledge, female learners gained more by the use of simulations than their male counterparts. No significant effect was found in the acquisition of the skill when computer simulations were used. Initial reduction of cognitive load was found when simulations were used and with time this increased. Experienced educators reduced the cognitive load through use of their knowledge and expertise and their role needs to be highlighted. Further studies are suggested to study the effect of a learner centred approach on decreasing the cognitive load and its effect on the acquisition of knowledge and skills.Mathematics, Science and Technology EducationD.

		"description": "Abstract\nEarly fault diagnosis of roller bearings is extremely important for rotating machines, especially for high speed, automatic and precise machines. Many research efforts have been focused on fault diagnosis and detection of roller bearings, since they constitute one the most important elements of rotating machinery. In this study a combination method is proposed for early damage detection of roller bearing.  Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is applied to the collected data for denoising and the resulting clean data are break-down into some elementary components called Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The normalized energy of three first IMFs are used as input for Support vector machine (SVM) to recognize whether signals are sorting out from healthy or faulty bearings. Then, since there is no robust guide to determine amplitude of added noise in EEMD technique, a new Performance improved EEMD (PIEEMD) is proposed to determine the appropriate value of added noise. A novel feature extraction method is also proposed for detecting small size defect using Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). TKEO is applied to IMFs obtained to create new feature vectors as input data for one-class SVM. The results of applying the method to acceleration signals collected from an experimental bearing test rig demonstrated that the method can be successfully used for early damage detection of roller bearings.\nMost of the diagnostic methods that have been developed up to now can be applied for the case stationary working conditions only (constant speed and load). However, bearings often work at time-varying conditions such as wind turbine supporting bearings, mining excavator bearings, vehicles, robots and all processes with run-up and run-down transients. Damage identification for bearings working under non-stationary operating conditions, especially for early/small defects, requires the use of appropriate techniques, which are generally different from those used for the case of stationary conditions, in order to extract fault-sensitive features which are at the same time insensitive to operational condition variations. Some methods have been proposed for damage detection of bearings working under time-varying speed conditions. However, their application might increase the instrumentation cost because of providing a phase reference signal. Furthermore, some methods such as order tracking methods still can be applied when the speed variation is limited. In this study, a novel combined method based on cointegration is proposed for the development of fault features which are sensitive to the presence of defects while in the same time they are insensitive to changes in the operational conditions. It does not require any additional measurements and can identify defects even for considerable speed variations. The signals acquired during run-up condition are decomposed into IMFs using the performance improved EEMD method. Then, the cointegration method is applied to the intrinsic mode functions to extract stationary residuals. The feature vectors are created by applying the Teager-Kaiser energy operator to the obtained stationary residuals. Finally, the feature vectors of the healthy bearing signals are utilized to construct a separating hyperplane using one-class support vector machine. Eventually the proposed method was applied to vibration signals measured on an experimental bearing test rig. The results verified that the method can successfully distinguish between healthy and faulty bearings even if the shaft speed changes dramatically",

		"description": "Sitem navigasi merupakan sistem yang digunakan untuk memandu perjalanan wahana dari suatu tempat ke suatu tujuan tertentu, dengan menggunakan perangkat peta digital dan informasi posisi dengan menggunakan satelit GPS (Global Positioning System). GPS merupakan teknologi penentuan posisi yang sangat modern dan canggih. Tetapi sistem penentuan posisi dengan GPS juga bisa mengalami gangguan dan kesalahan dalam menghitung posisi di atas permukaan bumi. Gangguan dan kesalahan akan mempengaruhi ketelitian dari posisi yang dihasilkan. Untuk mengatasi gangguan dan kesalahan (noise) dalam navigasi wahana di jalan raya, sistem navigasi harus dilengkapi dengan estimator. Estimator memiliki fungsi dalam memberikan prediksi terhadap data navigasi pada wahana untuk mengetahui noise yang terjadi.\n\nDalam penelitian ini, estimator yang digunakan adalah Kalman Filtering. Dengan menggunakan metode kalman filter akan didapatkan nilai prerdiksi dari koordinat wahana. Dari nilai prediksi dapat ditentukan berapa kesalahan yang terjadi pada koordinat wahana akibat mengalami noise. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukkan perbedaan koordinat prediksi dengan koordinat pengukuran dari GPS Geodetik mencapai 0,01 meter sampai 4 meter. Terdapat beberapa koordinat yang memiliki selisih lebih dari 4 meter bahkan mencapai 80 meter karena pengukuran GPS di lapangan mengalami cycle slips dan multipath. Hasil prediksi dari koordinat GPS handheld memberikan hasil 0,02 sampai 10 meter perbedaanya dengan koordinat pengukurannya. Hasil plotting koordinat prediksi pada citra Google Earth menunjukkan koordinat prediksi GPS Geodetik lebih sesuai dengan jalur navigasi wahana dibandingkan dengan koordinat prediksi GPS Handheld.\n\n\n\n==============================================================================================\n\n\n\nNavigation system is a system that used to guide vehicle from some plase to others places using digital map and information of position are based on GPS (Global Positioning Sytem Satellite).GPS is a modern and sophisticated technology used to determine position. Determining posistion using GPS sattelite can obtain noise and error in calculating position on the surface of the earth. This noise and error causing the inacurrate of posistion result.To overcome noise and error in navigation vehicle on the road, navigation system have to be equipped with estimator. Estimator has fuction in predicting navigation data from vehicle to knowing noise that hapened.\n\nIn this study, estimator to be used is the Kalman Filtering. By using the kalman filter will get prediction value of the vehicle coordinate on the road. With predicted value can be determined how error happens to coordinate due to experiencing noise.\n\nResults from this study indicate the kalman filter coordinates predicted from GPS Geodetic coordinates measuring value of difference reaches 0.01 to 4 meters. There are several coordinates that have a difference more than 4 meters, up to 80 meters due to the coordinates of the GPS measurement experiencing cycle clips and multipath. From GPS Handheld coordinate, prediction results are 0,02 meter until 10 meter differences from measurement coordinates.The result from prediction coordinates plotting in Google Earth images showing that prediction coordinates from GPS Geodetic is more suitable with navigation route than GPS Handheld coordinates prediction",

		"title": "Explaining Evolution via Constrained Persistent Perfect Phylogeny",
		"description": "BACKGROUND: \nThe perfect phylogeny is an often used model in phylogenetics since it provides an efficient basic procedure for representing the evolution of genomic binary characters in several frameworks, such as for example in haplotype inference. The model, which is conceptually the simplest, is based on the infinite sites assumption, that is no character can mutate more than once in the whole tree. A main open problem regarding the model is finding generalizations that retain the computational tractability of the original model but are more flexible in modeling biological data when the infinite site assumption is violated because of e.g. back mutations. A special case of back mutations that has been considered in the study of the evolution of protein domains (where a domain is acquired and then lost) is persistency, that is the fact that a character is allowed to return back to the ancestral state. In this model characters can be gained and lost at most once. In this paper we consider the computational problem of explaining binary data by the Persistent Perfect Phylogeny model (referred as PPP) and for this purpose we investigate the problem of reconstructing an evolution where some constraints are imposed on the paths of the tree.\nRESULTS: \nWe define a natural generalization of the PPP problem obtained by requiring that for some pairs (character, species), neither the species nor any of its ancestors can have the character. In other words, some characters cannot be persistent for some species. This new problem is called Constrained PPP (CPPP). Based on a graph formulation of the CPPP problem, we are able to provide a polynomial time solution for the CPPP problem for matrices whose conflict graph has no edges. Using this result, we develop a parameterized algorithm for solving the CPPP problem where the parameter is the number of characters.\nCONCLUSIONS: \nA preliminary experimental analysis shows that the constrained persistent perfect phylogeny model allows to explain efficiently data that do not conform with the classical perfect phylogeny model",

		"title": "Exploring the Teaching and Learning of English (L2) Writing : A Case of Three Junior Secondary Schools in Nigeria",
		"description": "Philosophiae Doctor - PhDNigeria is one of the most multilingual nations in Africa which consists of over 450 languages (Adegbija, 2004; Danladi, 2013). It has a population of more than 150 million people, with three major languages, namely Hausa, Yoruba and Igbo, and a number of minority languages. Despite its linguistic and cultural diversity, English is the main medium of instruction from primary to tertiary education. The negative effects of learning through the medium of English second language (L2) are evidenced in the learners\u2019 poor achievement in the external examination results of the National Examination Council (NECO) and the West African Examination Council (WAEC). There is an assumption that learners\u2019 poor performance in English (L2) is due to little attention given to English writing in schools, and the use of less appropriate or effective teaching approaches (Babalola, 2011). There is a special concern about the poor writing proficiency levels of learners, particularly in the Junior Secondary School (JSS) phase which is an exit to Senior Secondary School level where learners are expected to show strong academic literacy skills. Writing is a process which is central to learners\u2019 learning across the curriculum and it enables learners not only to access knowledge from different sources, but also to display the acquired knowledge in different domains. Learners\u2019 poor writing skills are a great concern given that English (L2) is the main medium of instruction at all levels of education in Nigeria. In light of the above, this study set out to explore the pedagogical strategies and problems encountered by both teachers and learners in English (L2) academic writing in Junior Secondary School (JSS 3) classrooms in the Ekiti State, Nigeria. Guided by Second Language Acquisition theory, the study explored the factors that influence second language learning, in relation to the sociocultural and contextual factors that influence learners\u2019 writing abilities. Through the lens of the Genre Pedagogical Theory and the Social Constructivist theory, it investigated teachers\u2019 pedagogical strategies in English (L2) writing, and analysed learners\u2019 written texts in order to understand the extent to which they reflected the features of specific genres that support learners\u2019 writing skills. Four JSS3 teachers in three schools were purposively selected to participate in the study. The study employed a qualitative research paradigm, underpinned by the interpretive theory. Through the use of an ethnographic design, the day-to-day happenings such as thoughts and engagements of both teachers and students in the English (L2) lessons were observed and recorded by means of an audio-recorder in order to build a comprehensive record of the participants\u2019 practice in the classroom. In addition, both semi-structured and unstructured interviews were conducted with the individual teachers. The students\u2019 written texts and other relevant documents were collected and analysed for the purpose of data triangulation. Ethical considerations such as informed consent, voluntary participation, respect and anonymity of participants were observed throughout the study. In this study, the findings show that the teaching of English (L2) writing is still a challenge to many teachers due to a variety of factors which include linguistic, pedagogical and structural factors. As a result, learners\u2019 academic writing suffers, especially writing to learn at secondary school level. Specifically, the findings of this study indicate that the teachers made use of traditional teaching approaches in the teaching of English (L2) writing as against the approaches recommended in the curriculum. The study also reveals that most of the JSS(3) students\u2019 level of proficiency in English writing is below the expected levels stipulated in the curriculum document, although some of them displayed good basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS), Other contributing factors to the learners\u2019 low academic writing proficiency in English (L2) include teachers\u2019 limited understanding and application of the Genre-Based Approach in teaching writing, inadequate language teaching and learning resources, learners\u2019 limited exposure to English (L2) and limited writing opportunities. The study concludes that while the use of the Genre-Based Approach is not the only strategy to enhance learners\u2019 writing skills, the teaching of writing remains crucial as it is central to language use in different knowledge domains. Students\u2019 writing proficiency is critical for cognitive and socio-economic development as it has implications for students\u2019 access to knowledge and academic literacy which spills over to tertiary education. In a country like Nigeria where the main language of instruction is English, there is a need to prioritise teacher \r\ndevelopment and to revisit the curriculum to determine how it meets the academic needs of learners in this century",

		"title": "The effects of laforin, malin, Stbd1, and Ptg deficiencies on heart glycogen levels in Pompe disease mouse models",
		"description": "Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)Pompe disease (PD) is a rare metabolic myopathy characterized by loss of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), the enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen to glucose within the lysosomes. PD cells accumulate massive quantities of glycogen within their lysosomes, and as such, PD is classified as a \u201clysosomal storage disease\u201d (LSD). GAA-deficient cells also exhibit accumulation of autophagic debris. Symptoms of severe infantile PD include extreme muscle weakness, hypotonia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, resulting in death before one year of age.  \r\nCertain LSDs are currently being successfully treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which involves intravenous infusion of a recombinant enzyme to counteract the endogenous deficiency.  ERT has been less successful in PD, however, due to ineffective delivery of the recombinant enzyme.  Alternatively, specific genes deletion may reduce lysosomal glycogen load, and could thus be targeted in PD therapy development. Absence of malin (EPM2B) or laforin (EPM2A) has been proposed to impair autophagy, which could reduce lysosomal glycogen levels.  Additionally, deficiency of Stbd1 has been postulated to disable lysosomal glycogen import.  Furthermore, Ptg deficiency was previously reported to abrogate Lafora body formation and correct neurological abnormalities in Lafora disease mouse models and could have similar effects on PD pathologies.  \r\n The goal of this study was to characterize the effects of homozygous disruption of Epm2a, Epm2b, Stbd1, and Ptg loci on total glycogen levels in PD mouse model heart tissue, as in severe infantile PD, it is accumulation of glycogen in the heart that results in fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Gaa-/- mice were intercrossed with Epm2a-/-, Epm2b-/-, Stbd1-/-, and Ptg-/- mice to generate wildtype (WT), single knockout, and double knockout mice.  The results indicated that Gaa-/- hearts accumulated up to 100-fold more glycogen than the WT. These mice also displayed cardiac hypertrophy. However, deficiency of Epm2a, Epm2b, Stbd1, or PTG in the Gaa-/- background did not reveal changes of statistical significance in either heart glycogen or cardiac hypertrophy.  Nevertheless, since total glycogen was measured, these deficiencies should not be discarded in future discussions of PD therapy, as increasing sample sizes and/or distinguishing cytosolic from lysosomal glycogen content may yet reveal differences of greater significance",

Unfortunately, visually impaired are still facing difficulties in interaction with websites. Particularly, screen reader is unable to facilitate disabled users to identify images such as basic geometric shapes. Inability to identify the shapes displayed on the screen creates restriction to interact and comprehend the content of websites for visually impaired. Thus, this project examines earlier researches and eases the web interaction of the blind people by identifying the shape of visual image converted into tactile representation using Braille device. For further investigation of the hypotheses, qualitative and quantitative method is used. The study findings are addressed to build a system that tackles the issue that screen reader is unable to address. System evaluation is executed upon producing the prototype of the system which comprises of user testing. The system is expected to improve understanding the content of webpage and enhance the interaction of visually impaired with web.

		"title": "Methodology for the selection and implementation of environmental aspects and performance indicators in ports",
		"description": "It is broadly known that efficient ports are crucial for the economic development of their surrounding area. However, the loading and unloading of goods in the ports, the related ship traffic, and the hinterland distribution can cause a number of negative environmental impacts.\r\nIn this thesis, the concepts of environmental aspects and indicators are reviewed, as two relevant elements used in the environmental management. The importance of both elements within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise that the identification of environmental aspects and the use of indicators are essential processes, they do not specify any methodology to undertake these tasks. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already identified their significant aspects and performance indicators, most of these ports do not use any standardized method. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports may not necessarily be science-based, systematic in approach or appropriate for the purpose of implementing effective environmental management.\r\nFor these reasons, it was detected that a new methodology able to identify port' aspects and their most adequate indicators was needed. The developed methodology is called EPORTS.CAT and it comprises two main tools: a Tool for the identification and assessment of Environmental Aspects in Ports (TEAP) and a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP). The first aims at the identification of the major environmental aspects that may be generated in a port and the assessment of their significance (TEAP); and the second at the identification of performance indicators that are related with the aspects and the provision of guidelines for their implementation (TEIP).\r\nThis method has been developed after analysing the strengths, weaknesses and challenges of the existing techniques, the recommendations from the Environmental Management System (EMS) standards and the advice of specialists. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user (i.e. port environmental manager). This new\r\nmethodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. EPORTS.CAT is a practical and time-saving tool for port managers to easily determine significant aspects and indicators in their port areas.\u00c9s \u00e0mpliament reconegut que els ports s\u00f3n crucials per al desenvolupament econ\u00f2mic de les \u00e0rees del seu entorn. No obstant, la c\u00e0rrega i desc\u00e0rrega de mercaderies en els ports, el tr\u00e0fic de vaixells, aix\u00ed com la distribuci\u00f3 de mercaderies cap a l\u2019interior poden causar una s\u00e8rie d\u2019impactes ambientals negatius. En aquesta tesi s\u2019analitzen els conceptes d\u2019aspecte i indicador ambientals, que s\u00f3n dos elements rellevants utilitzats en la gesti\u00f3 ambiental. Tamb\u00e9 es justifica la import\u00e0ncia que tenen tots dos elements dins d\u2019un Sistema de Gesti\u00f3 Ambiental (SGA). Encara que les normes dels SGA reconeixen que la identificaci\u00f3 dels aspectes ambientals i l'\u00fas d'indicadors s\u00f3n processos essencials, no especifiquen cap metodologia per a realitzar aquestes tasques. A m\u00e9s, la recerca duta a terme en aquesta tesi demostra que, si b\u00e9 hi ha un alt percentatge de ports europeus que ja han identificat els seus aspectes significatius i indicadors, la majoria d'aquests ports no utilitzen cap m\u00e8tode estandarditzat. Aix\u00f2 suggereix que alguns dels procediments utilitzats pels ports poden no tenir necess\u00e0riament una base cient\u00edfica, o b\u00e9, no ser sistem\u00e0tics o apropiats per al prop\u00f2sit d\u2019implementar una correcta gesti\u00f3 ambiental. Per aquestes raons, es va detectar que era necess\u00e0ria una nova metodologia capa\u00e7 d'identificar aspectes ambientals en ports i els seus indicadors m\u00e9s adequats. La metodologia desenvolupada es diu EPORTS.CAT i consta de dues eines principals: la Tool for the identification and assessment of Environmental Aspects in Ports (TEAP) i la Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP). La primera t\u00e9 per objectiu identificar els principals aspectes ambientals que poden generar-se en un port i avaluar-ne la seva significan\u00e7a (TEAP); i la segona identificar els indicadors que estan relacionats amb els aspectes i proveir de directrius per a la seva correcta aplicaci\u00f3 (TEIP). Aquest m\u00e8tode ha estat desenvolupat despr\u00e9s d'analitzar els punts forts i febles de les t\u00e8cniques existents, les recomanacions de les normes dels Sistemes de Gesti\u00f3 Ambiental (SGA) i l\u2019assessorament d\u2019especialistes. Es tracta d'una eina amb una base cient\u00edfica i inform\u00e0tica (www.eports.cat) que proporciona un c\u00e0lcul r\u00e0pid, i est\u00e0 dissenyada per a ser tan f\u00e0cil d'usar com sigui possible. Aquesta nova metodologia \u00e9s aplicable a tot tipus de ports sense importar la seva mida, ubicaci\u00f3 geogr\u00e0fica o perfil comercial; proporciona resultats espec\u00edfics per a cada un.

		"title": "The role of the principal as instructional leader in improving learner achievement in South African primary schools",
		"description": "The role played by the principal as instructional leader worldwide is critical due to its direct and indirect impact on learner achievement.In South African primary schools the role of the principal as instructional leader in improving learning achievement is a pressing issue since most South African primary school learners perform far below par as determined by benchmarking carried out by local and international education assessment agencies with reference to curriculum goals and literacy and numeracy milestones.This descriptive exploratory study examined the role of the principal as instructional leader in primary schools in South Africa with special reference to the Tshwane South District, Gauteng Province. The study was informed by a literature review of local and international sources related to theoretical perspectives on instructional leadership, the features of instructional leadership that impact on learner achievement and selected models of instructional leadership. An overview of contextual and school factors which shape primary school learner achievement in South Africa with reference to the rural and township communities also framed the empirical inquiry. A mixed method study was conducted according to two phases: Phase 1 comprised the quantitative component (questionnaires); Phase 2 comprised the qualitative component (interviews). Both phases were conducted in the Tshwane South District, Gauteng Province. In both phases data were gathered from primary school principals and Institute Development Support Officials (IDSOs) selected by random and purposeful sampling respectively. The questionnaire findings indicated that the principals and IDSOs had adequate qualifications and experience, and that key school policies are in place. However, the principals are less confident about policy implementation, particularly with regard to educator and learner discipline. They face many systemic problems, such as inadequate school resources and additional funds in no fee-paying schools to improve the infrastructure and reduce the learner-teacher ratios. The findings from the interviews indicated that the principals struggle to maintain participative management with the school governing bodies; are hampered by contextual factors, especially poor school infrastructure; and are challenged to meet the requirements of annual benchmarking assessments. Based on the findings of the literature study and the empirical inquiry recommendations are made to improve practice, including a call for the professional development of principals in project management and fundraising.Educational Leadership and ManagementD.

		"description": "In graph analysis, the Shortest Path problem identifies the optimal, most cost effective, path between two nodes. This problem has been the object of many studies and extensions in heterogeneous domains such as: speech recognition, social network analysis, biological sequence alignment, path planning, or zero-sum games among others. Although the shortest path focuses on the optimal cost of reaching a destination node, it does not take into account other useful information contained on the graph, such as the degree of connectivity of two nodes. On the other hand, measures taking connectivity information into account have their own drawbacks, specially when graphs become large. A new family of distances which interpolates between both extremes is introduced by the Randomized Shortest Path (RSP) framework. By spreading randomization through a graph, the RSP leads to applications where some degree of randomness would be desired. Through this work, we try to investigate whether the RSP framework can be applied to different domains in which randomization is useful, and either solve an existing problem with a new approach, or prove to outperform existing methods.(FSA - Sciences de l'ing\u00e9nieur) -- UCL, 201",

Ideally schools interested in starting or improving their science fair programs could find a way to emulate some of the identified components. Successful was defined by having received recognition on some level at the International Science and Engineering Fair at least nine out of the last ten years. Twelve schools were identified as meeting this definition and five agreed to participate in the study. The schools represented diverse geographic areas as well as types of schools. Included in the study was a private school, two public schools and two public magnet schools. Data were collected through surveys, interviews, observations and document analysis. The climate of the school and the climate of the community were key features identified as helping to foster successful science fair programs. Unique features were identified as being present at most of the schools. These included embedding science research in\nthe curriculum, requiring participation in science research for all students, flexible scheduling and offering elective science research classes. As the nation is increasingly focused on preparing students to enter STEM fields it seems that including science research in the science curriculum and emulating some of these unique components of successful science fair schools would be worth pursuing",

The annual National Senior Certificate examinations results are a testimony to this pathetic and unenviable situation. This situation warrants the immediate intervention of the Ministry of Basic Education and academics from institutions of higher learning, who can assist by providing resources to create a conducive learning environment in dysfunctional schools. A qualitative phenomenological design was employed in this study to explore the curriculum experiences of the interviewees. The research approach provided participants with an opportunity to describe and interpret the experiences of the phenomena as they were lived-out in a natural setting. The University of South Africa, College of Education rescued the situation by appointing expert teachers from the Dinaledi schools to offer extra classes on Saturdays and school vacations to the affected schools.  \nDOI: 10.5901/mjss.2014.v5n6p31",

		"description": "Design and control of the bipedal humanoid robot locomotion are challenging areas of research. Accurate models of the kinematics and dynamics of the robot are essential to achieve bipedal locomotion. Bipedal walking can be achieved either with flat-foot or toe-foot walking. Flat-foot walking is more stable but slower, whereas toe-foot walking produces more natural and faster motion. Furthermore in toe-foot walking it is possible to perform stretch knee walking. The mechanical structure of the robot is designed with compact modular parts so that the robot kinematics can be modelled as a multi-point-mass system, and its dynamics are modelled applying the inverted pendulum model and the zero-moment-point concept. The optimality in the gait trajectory is achieved exploiting augmented model predictive control methods taking into consideration the trade-off between walking speed and stability. The robustness and stability of the walking gaits and posture in the presence of internal or external disturbances are enhanced by adopting angular compensation with joint control techniques. The thesis develops a flat-foot optimal walking gait generation method. The effectiveness of the control technique and the passive-toe design is validated by simulation tests with the robot walking on slope, stepping over an obstacle and climbing a stair. The walking gaits are implemented on a mid-size (1.6 meter, 58 kg) bipedal robot. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the new proposed Augmented Model Predictive Control (AMPC) method has improved and produced a smoother gaits tracking trajectory in comparison with existing LQR and preview methods; and at the same time the proposed algorithms are able to reduce noise interference.Open Acces",

		"title": "A hydrogeological approach in urban underground infrastructures",
		"description": "The competition for space in urban areas due to an exponential growth of population makes derground engineering plays a crucial role in the development of cities. Urban underground infrastructures deal with variables such as cost, duration, safety, and management; faces political, social, economic and environmental issues; and guarantees future sustainability, maintenance, and energy efficiency. To do so, all these concepts and variables must be kept in mind during the whole construction process: (I) project design, (II) project construction and (III) project exploitation. This thesis aims to demonstrate how the construction cycle deals with the various impacts produced by the interaction of underground constructions with groundwater at each stage of the process, with a view to providing improved processes. During the project design previous data is collected, new data is generated, created and processed, helping to understand\r\nthe context and to design the infrastructure. There are very advanced tools to store and process hydrogeological data, but most of these tools are not common in infrastructure projects. Often most of the constructions only perform the minimum\r\nlegal requirement to characterize the ground: a pumping test. Therefore, there is a need to provide the constructors with a set of methods and tools to allow them to increase the quality of their hydrogeological analysis, which will allow early detection problems associated with the groundwater.\r\n\r\nThe interaction of underground constructions with groundwater generates impacts. These impacts can usually be minimized by using mitigation measures. The most common impacts caused by underground constructions are the groundwater barrier effect and the groundwater pressure distribution and limitation under the bottom slab. In the literature there are many examples and designs to mitigate both groundwater barrier effect and groundwater pressure distribution impacts. However, there is no design that integrates both solutions. This thesis presents an innovative groundwater by-pass design that enables the groundwater to flow through the structure and provide a homogenous distribution of the water pressure under the bottom slab. The new integrated design was applied to the largest underground infrastructure of Barcelona: La Sagrera railway station. A hydrogeological model was implemented to test the original and the integrated designs in three different scenarios. This new solution mitigates the groundwater barrier effect and optimizes the bottom slab, considerably reducing the costs and increasing safety during the construction phase. \r\n\r\nMonitoring is required when dewatering underground constructions in order to anticipate unexpected events and preserve nearby existing structures. The most accurate and spread monitoring method to measure displacements is levelling, a pointlike surveying technique that typically allows for tens of discrete in-situ sub-millimetric measurements per squared kilometer.\r\nAnother emerging technique for mapping soil deformation is the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which is based on SAR images acquired from orbiting satellites or by ground-based stations (GB-SAR). This remote sensing technique can provide better spatial point density than levelling, more extensive spatial coverage and cheaper acquisitions. Both satellite and ground-based SAR systems have been used and tested in a variety of analyses. However, nobody has applied this technology as a monitoring tool during construction works yet. This thesis contributes to data storing and data analysis software that implies new and significant method developments for increasing the quality of the hydrogeological analysis; it provides new approaches to address the groundwater corrective\r\nmeasures definition during the design stage, and it develops and applies new methods of nfrastructure monitoring using ground-based and satellite SAR sensors during the construction stage.Degut al creixement exponencial de la poblaci\u00f3 i tenint en compte que l'espai dins les \u00e0rees urbanes \u00e9s finit \u00e9s, necessari la construcci\u00f3 d'infraestructures subterr\u00e0nies.

A la literatura hi ha molts dissenys que permeten mitigar l'efecte barrera i millorar la distribuci\u00f3 de les subpressions, per\u00f2 no hi ha cap disseny que integri les dues solucions. Aquesta tesi presenta un disseny innovador per bypassar les aig\u00fces subterr\u00e0nies a trav\u00e9s de l'estructura proporcionant una distribuci\u00f3 homog\u00e8nia de les subpressions sota la llosa de fons.

Quan una construcci\u00f3 rebaixa el nivell fre\u00e0tic cal auscultar els nivells i la deformaci\u00f3 del terreny per tal d'anticipar esdeveniments inesperats i preservar les estructures properes existents. El m\u00e8tode actual m\u00e9s utilitzat per mesurar despla\u00e7aments \u00e9s l'anivellament, que permet avaluar in situ desenes de punts discrets amb una precisi \u00f3 submil\u00b7lim\u00e8trica. Una t\u00e8cnica emergent \u00e9s el Radar d'Obertura Sint\u00e8tica Interferom\u00e8trica (InSAR), que es basa en imatges SAR adquirides des de sat\u00e8l\u00b7lits en \u00f2rbita o b\u00e9 des d'estacions al terra (GB-SAR). Aquesta t\u00e8cnica de detecci\u00f3 remota proporciona una major cobertura espacial i m\u00e9s econ\u00f2mica que els m\u00e8todes d'auscultaci\u00f3 tradicionals. Tot i que la tecnologia SAR s'ha utilitzat i validat en una gran varietat d'an\u00e0lisis, ning\u00fa ha aplicat encara aquesta tecnologia com a eina d'auscultaci\u00f3 durant la construcci\u00f3 d'infraestructures. Aquesta tesi contribueix a: (I) millorar l'emmagatzematge i processament de dades a trav\u00e9s de nous desenvolupaments i m\u00e8todes que permeten augmentar la qualitat de l'an\u00e0lisi hidrogeol\u00f2gica; (II) oferir noves formes d'an\u00e0lisi per al disseny de mesures correctores durant l'etapa de disseny; i (III) desenvolupar i aplicar nous m\u00e8todes d'auscultaci\u00f3 d'infraestructura a trav\u00e9s de sensors SAR (terrestres i sat\u00e8l\u00b7lit) durant la fase constructiva.La limitaci\u00f3n de espacio en \u00e1reas urbanas junto al crecimiento exponencial de la poblaci\u00f3n, hace necesaria la\r\nconstrucci\u00f3n de infraestructuras subterr\u00e1neas. Nuevos conceptos en planificaci\u00f3n urbana junto con los\r\navances tecnol\u00f3gicos en la construcci\u00f3n hacen posible la ejecuci\u00f3n de infraestructuras m\u00e1s grandes y de m\u00e1s\r\neficiencia. No obstante, variables tales como el coste, la duraci\u00f3n, la seguridad y la gesti\u00f3n; los problemas\r\npol\u00edticos, sociales, econ\u00f3micos y ambientales; y garantizar la sostenibilidad futura, el mantenimiento y la\r\neficiencia energ\u00e9tica, hacen de esta ejecuci\u00f3n un problema complejo. Por ello, todas estas variables deben\r\nestar presentes durante todo el proceso constructivo: (I) dise\u00f1o del proyecto, (II) construcci\u00f3n del proyecto y\r\n(III) explotaci\u00f3n del proyecto. Esta tesis tiene como objetivo principal saber c\u00f3mo el ciclo constructivo (dise\u00f1o\r\ndel proyecto, construcci\u00f3n y explotaci\u00f3n de proyectos) procesa las problem\u00e1ticas inducidas por la\r\ninteracci\u00f3n de las nuevas infraestructuras subterr\u00e1neas urbanas con las aguas subterr\u00e1neas para luego\r\nmejorarlo.\r\nDurante el dise\u00f1o del proyecto (fase I) se recogen los datos hist\u00f3ricos, se generan nuevos datos (pozos,\r\npruebas de campo, muestras qu\u00edmicas ...) y se procesa conjuntamente, lo que ayuda a entender el contexto y\r\nel dise\u00f1o de la infraestructura. Existen herramientas muy avanzadas para almacenar y procesar informaci\u00f3n\r\ngeol\u00f3gica, hidroqu\u00edmica e hidrogeol\u00f3gica, aunque la mayor\u00eda de estas herramientas no son comunes en los proyectos de infraestructuras subterr\u00e1neas ya que es com\u00fan que la mayor\u00eda de las construcciones s\u00f3lo se\r\nrealice una prueba de bombeo para caracterizar el subsuelo. Por lo tanto, hay una necesidad de proporcionar\r\nun conjunto de m\u00e9todos y de herramientas a los constructores para que puedan aumentar la calidad de su\r\nan\u00e1lisis (como pruebas de bombeo), para aumentar as\u00ed la detecci\u00f3n temprana de problemas asociados a las\r\naguas subterr\u00e1neas.\r\nLa interacci\u00f3n de las construcciones subterr\u00e1neas con las aguas subterr\u00e1neas genera impactos. Estos impactos\r\ngeneralmente pueden minimizarse mediante el uso de medidas correctoras. Los impactos m\u00e1s comunes\r\ncausados por las construcciones subterr\u00e1neas son el efecto barrera (impacto en las aguas subterr\u00e1neas) y la\r\ndistribuci\u00f3n y limitaci\u00f3n de subpresiones bajo la losa de fondo (impacto en la construcci\u00f3n subterr\u00e1nea). En la\r\nliteratura hay muchos ejemplos de dise\u00f1os para mitigar tanto el efecto barrera y como para mejorar la\r\ndistribuci\u00f3n de las subpresiones bajo la losa de fondo. Sin embargo, no hay ning\u00fan dise\u00f1o que integre ambas\r\nsoluciones. Es il\u00f3gico dise\u00f1ar una medida correctora sin tener en cuenta todos los factores que intervienen en\r\nel problema. Esta tesis presenta un dise\u00f1o innovador de by-pass para las aguas subterr\u00e1neas que permite el\r\nflujo de agua subterr\u00e1nea a trav\u00e9s de la estructura a la vez que proporciona una distribuci\u00f3n homog\u00e9nea de\r\nlas subpresiones bajo la losa de fondo. El nuevo dise\u00f1o se ha aplicado en la infraestructura subterr\u00e1nea m\u00e1s\r\ngrande de Barcelona: la futura estaci\u00f3n de tren de La Sagrera. Se ha realizado un modelo hidrogeol\u00f3gico para\r\nprobar los nuevos dise\u00f1os en tres escenarios diferentes. Esta nueva soluci\u00f3n mitiga el efecto barrera de las\r\naguas subterr\u00e1neas y optimiza la losa de fondo, lo que reduce considerablemente los costes y aumenta la\r\nseguridad durante la fase de construcci\u00f3n.\r\nDurante la construcci\u00f3n (fase II) se genera una gran cantidad de nuevos datos. Es necesario auscultar los\r\nniveles y la deformaci\u00f3n del terreno cuando una construcci\u00f3n rebaja el fre\u00e1tico con el fin de anticiparse a\r\nacontecimientos inesperados y a preservar las estructuras y / o edificios cercanos existentes. El m\u00e9todo actual\r\nm\u00e1s usado para medir desplazamientos en el terreno es la nivelaci\u00f3n, una t\u00e9cnica que permite evaluar in situ\r\ndecenas de puntos discretos con una precisi\u00f3n sub-milim\u00e9trica. Una t\u00e9cnica emergente para medir la\r\ndeformaci\u00f3n del suelo es el Radar de Apertura Sint\u00e9tica Interferom\u00e9trica (InSAR), que se basa en im\u00e1genes\r\nSAR adquiridas o bien desde sat\u00e9lites en \u00f3rbita o bien desde estaciones en tierra (GB-SAR). Esta t\u00e9cnica de\r\ndetecci\u00f3n remota proporciona una mayor cobertura espacial y m\u00e1s barata que los m\u00e9todos de auscultaci\u00f3n\r\ntradicionales. Aunque la tecnolog\u00eda SAR se ha utilizado y validado en una gran variedad de an\u00e1lisis, nadie ha\r\naplicado esta tecnolog\u00eda como una herramienta de auscultaci\u00f3n durante la construcci\u00f3n de infraestructuras.\r\nEsta tesis contribuye a mejorar el almacenamiento y tratamiento de datos a trav\u00e9s de nuevos desarrollos y\r\nm\u00e9todos que permiten aumentar la calidad del an\u00e1lisis hidrogeol\u00f3gico; ofrece nuevas formas de an\u00e1lisis para\r\nel dise\u00f1o de medidas correctoras durante la etapa de dise\u00f1o; y desarrolla y aplica nuevos m\u00e9todos de\r\nauscultaci\u00f3n de infraestructura a trav\u00e9s de sensores SAR (terrestres y sat\u00e9lite) durante la fase constructivaPostprint (published version",

		"title": "An investigation of university students' views about teaching and learning English through their own experiences in high schools and university of mainland China",
		"description": "English has become one of the most important subjects after the restoration of the College Entrance Examination in 1978 in mainland China. With the development of the Chinese economy and technology, Chinese students and graduates are provided with more opportunities to study and work collaboratively with the world community. Consequently, their English proficiency is closely related to their study and career plans. Therefore, it is important to investigate how students perceive their English learning and their teachers\u2019 teaching as this could both benefit students and teachers in an emerging discourse of English education.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate university students' perceptions about their teachers\u2019 teaching and their learning English through their own experiences in high schools and a university in mainland China. The investigation focused on the following key areas: the participants\u2019 perceptions of their English learning and teachers\u2019 teaching in high schools; the perceptions of their English learning and their teachers\u2019 teaching in the university; a comparative examination of these two learning discourses from the views of the students; and the participants\u2019 preferred learning and teaching models in the Chinese context.\n\nThis study employed both quantitative and qualitative research approaches for data collection and analysis. It included two phases: the questionnaire and semi- structured interviews. The statistical data were analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science) software version 21. The textual data collected from the semi-structured interviews were analyzed using the NVivo software version 10. Thematic analysis was used in the qualitative data analysis.\n\nThe results of this study indicated that huge differences of English teaching models utilized between high schools and universities existed in mainland China. This huge gap could create problems for Chinese students\u2019 learning transition and individual learning. The findings suggested that the current English assessments for both high schools students and university students should be improved, particularly, the English test in the College Entrance Examination. Meanwhile, transitional guidance was strongly suggested by university students, particularly, to take a shift from a perception of traditional classrooms in high schools to a \u2018student-centered\u2019 classroom in the university. Based on the findings, policy implications, implications for practice and directions for further research were also addressed",

		"description": "The study focuses on analyzing a reform programme implemented in the Punjab province in Pakistan. The reform was implemented to improve school education system. The study fings corroborate that the reform programme has made a notable effort to make education provisions available, accessible, acceptable and adaptable by improving access, quality and governance in the government schools of the Lahore district. There have been improvements in the school education system since the reform programme is implemented. Despite all the efforts made by the people in the core and in periphery, and these improvements, the school education system still needs to be improved. Especially the primary schools need immediate attention to remove issues related to different reform provisions. The study made an attempt to study education policies and reforms from the inception of Pakistan. The purpose was to analyze the improvements in the education system as well as the reasons for its failure. The reform program studied specifically for the study has helped provide many education provisions at different levels of schooling. As a result of these efforts, the overall teaching/learning environment in the schools is improved. There are more students studying in the schools and graduating from schools to contribute to society and national economy effectively. However, there are still many areas that can be improved at different levels of schooling especially primary education. Primary education provides the very basis to the entire learning experience in schools and it is still in need of improvement. The primary schools need to improve girls\u00b4 access, providing facilities, qualified human resources, cleanliness in schools, and a child-centered and child-friendly teaching-learning environment. The individual attention can help improve their learning. For the medium of instructions in primary school, the school management needs to hire qualified teachers  form within the community, so that they are better able to communicate with the students in their mother tongue. Such issues allow girls students to drop out early and affect the learning of all students in primary schools. There are many good practices occurring in schools as a result of the reform programme but the government need to enhance these practices in schools. So that the overall impact of the reform improve school education experience by engaging students in innovative activities, such as, providing them computer literacy, arranging international competitive exams for the students, participating in debates, science project competitions at provincial and national level and cultural activities. Such activities have improved the learning experience of students. But the issues related to these activities and learning experience in primary schools needs to be improved. Therefore, the students can contribute to society as effective individuals",

		"title": "To The Angel of Schooling, Write: Redeeming the Telos of Schooling as a Liturgical Institution, And the Role of the School Administrator as Peace-Weaver, Through the Lens of Prophetic Imagination",
		"description": "The purpose of this dissertation is to critique the institution of mass schooling by holding up the failure of both its liturgy and its pedagogies as part of the larger failure inherent in the overarching telos of the marketplace. The problem addressed here is that schooling operates as a religious institution through its proffering a sacred cosmology around what I will conceptualize as \u201cThe Religion of the Marketplace\u201d that shapes students in the imago dei of the Homo Economicus whose hearts are shaped to worship the god, Mammon, by the disordered love of avarice to find peace, contentment, and happiness through the theology of consumption. This dissertation examines the schoolhouse as a liturgical institution, arguing not that schools should be religious, but rather that they are \u201cre-ligious\u201d (Baker and Letendre, 2005; Meyer, 2009) in that they bind us to what Charles Taylor (2004) describes as social imaginaries (ways of seeing and being in the world) that then become \u201creligious\u201d (held as sacred) for a given culture when they are legitimated, replicated and perpetuated through their specific pedagogies and practices.  Using exegesis of biblical texts and a historical exploration of the vice of avarice, I will argue that the cultivation of Mammon undermines both moral and political health because it erodes empathy and keeps one\u2019s focus on the disordered love (Augustine, 1958) of one\u2019s own self-gratification and \u2013glorification. This work seeks to address the moral, philosophical, political, and theological problems that are deeper than the issues addressed by the current public discourse on school reform. By theorizing the concepts of \u201cMammon\u201d and \u201cLiturgical Institutions\u201d (Smith, 2009), this inquiry explores the ways in which the Religion of the Marketplace shapes a theology of consumption that drives schooling, and the monstrous consequences of its so doing. This conceptualization opens the way to speak about the need for the school administrator to act as prophetic peace-weaver, the one tasked within the organization of a given school to usher in new modes of discourse and praxis in order to see not school reform, but school redemption occur",

		"title": "Factors impeding organisational change in education :a case study of Tatweer",
		"description": "PhD ThesisThis study investigates the factors impeding organisational change in the public educational sector of Saudi Arabia. It does so to avoid the waste of financial resources by proposing solutions for better management of change in the public education sector. It also identifies the sources of resistance to change, approaches used to control them, and explores the role of internal and external communication in stakeholders\u2019 engagement and in the management of change initiatives.\r\nA case study approach was adopted, focusing on the King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Public Education Development Project (Tatweer), the most comprehensive reform initiative introduced in the Saudi educational system to date. Data collection occurred via semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and reviewing documentary evidence. The research used snowball and maximum variation sampling to interview key informants from officials from the Ministry of Education, as well as teachers and head teachers at Tatweer pilot schools and private schools, to provide in-depth insights into the context of change and to explore the factors limiting implementation.\r\nThe software package Nvivo10 was utilised to aid analysis. This commenced by coding to explore and compare perspectives. Matrices were developed for comparative pattern analysis at the Ministry of Education and school levels. Private schools do not perceive public schools as competitors and competition is not visible between public schools.\r\nThe analysis of the management of the project revealed several problems surrounding the project\u2019s implementation, particularly insufficient communication, lack of incentives, limited training, and improper resource allocation. Resistance to change emerged due to insufficient communication and incentives. The culture and social norms of Saudi society interfere with effective organisational management.\r\nInternal and external communication plays a crucial role in change initiatives and minimising resistance to change. However, in the Saudi public educational system, external communication is limited and tends to be viewed as superfluous, competition between schools does not exist, and external stakeholder participation is minimal. The findings revealed that parents\u2019 minimal involvement impeded the implementation of change initiatives. Schools seldom engage in strategies to enhance student recruitment and without providing incentives, schools are less interested in enrolling additional students, which reduces competition, and consequently external communication remains of marginal importance in Saudi Arabia",

		"description": "The perfect phylogeny is one of the most used models in different areas of\ncomputational biology. In this paper we consider the problem of the Persistent\nPerfect Phylogeny (referred as P-PP) recently introduced to extend the perfect\nphylogeny model allowing persistent characters, that is characters can be\ngained and lost at most once. We define a natural generalization of the P-PP\nproblem obtained by requiring that for some pairs (character, species), neither\nthe species nor any of its ancestors can have the character. In other words,\nsome characters cannot be persistent for some species. This new problem is\ncalled Constrained P-PP (CP-PP).\n  Based on a graph formulation of the CP-PP problem, we are able to provide a\npolynomial time solution for the CP-PP problem for matrices having an empty\nconflict-graph. In particular we show that all such matrices admit a persistent\nperfect phylogeny in the unconstrained case. Using this result, we develop a\nparameterized algorithm for solving the CP-PP problem where the parameter is\nthe number of characters. A preliminary experimental analysis of the algorithm\nshows that it performs efficiently and it may analyze real haplotype data not\nconforming to the classical perfect phylogeny model",

		"description": "Analysis and recognition of objects in complex scenes is a demanding task for a computer. There is a selection mechanism, named visual attention, that optimizes the visual system, in which only the important parts of the scene are considered at a time. In this work, an object-based visual attention model with both bottom-up and top-down modulation is applied to the humanoid robot NAO to allow a new attention procedure to the robot. This means that the robot, by using its cameras, can recognize geometric figures even with the competition for the attention of all the objects in the image in real time. The proposed method is validated through some tests with 13 to 14 year old kids interacting with the robot NAO that provides some tips (such as the perimeter and area calculation formulas) and recognizes the figure showed by these children. The results are very promissor and show that the proposed approach can contribute for inserting robotics in the educacional context.S\u00e3o Paulo State Research Foundation (FAPESP)Brazilian National Research Council (CNPq",

This initiative was launched in 2010 by the Centre of Talented Youth, Ireland (CTYI) in order to address the under-representation of high-ability second-level students from low-income families within CTYI\u2019s older student summer programmes.\\ud\nThe need for this programme, and in turn, for such research developed out of an awareness regarding the under-representation of students from areas of disadvantage within programmes focusing on the development of academic talent at CTYI (and within the field of gifted education). In addition, there was a general perception that these young people are less likely to take part in higher education upon completion of their secondary school studies.\\ud\nThe study applies a qualitative case study methodology and uses of a number of research methods, (questionnaires, interviews, & focus groups) with different sets of research participants (students, parents & schools) and across a number of years (2011-2014). The research findings indicate four key themes; academic, social, and personal benefits together with a small number of negative consequences. This case addresses a deficit in the literature which calls for strategies focusing on the talent development of high-ability, low-income students through the presentation of a detailed description of this innovative programme. The findings from this case study provide important lessons about this population of students which may provide readers with valuable insights should the programme be replicated in the future",

Home automation system nowadays has become an alternative for the user to take care of their home. Previously, people always rely on other people to take care of their home. Those who want to leave their home for vacation or outstation has to ask other people\u2019s help, for example, their neighbor to water their garden. Today, with the assistance of the home automation system, it allows the user to monitor their home remotely, even if they are away from their home. In this project, a remote watering system which is a system that enable user to monitor and control the watering system via a web server has been developed. This system consists of two parts, the watering system and the web server interface. The watering system consist of Arduino microcontroller, soil humidity sensor and a water pump. The sensors will read the current soil humidity and update it on the web server. The second part of the system which is the web server interface enables the user to see their garden\u2019s current soil humidity reading and allow them to turn on and turn off the button to control the watering system. The system also allow user to activate automation mode if she does not want to control it manually. For this project, an incremental model is adopted for the project development and testing is done to test the functionality of the system. After several testing done, it can be concluded that the system has successfully fulfilled its functionality as proposed in this projec",

		"description": "Reading is the ability to extract meaning from written text. When students learn to read, they should be able to comprehend the text during reading process. Reading difficulties become most apparent when the students are unable to grasp the meaning from a text. They find it hard to get main idea, supporting details, and even deciding the schematic structure of the text. This is because the students do not know specific technique that can guide them to understanding the text and predicting the meaning. As the effort to improve students\u2019 reading comprehension, teacher should be more creative and make learning process more interesting and more favored by learners. Therefore, the writer conducts a study about \u201cTeaching Reading comprehension of Narrative Text by Using Mind Mapping Technique\u201d. The purposes of this study are to find out the effectiveness of mind mapping technique toward students\u2019 reading comprehension and to know the obstacle in applying mind mapping technique. This research was a pre experimental research which used one class as an experimental class. The sample of this study was class VIII-b of SMP Inshafuddin Banda Aceh. The techniques used in obtaining the data were test (pre-test and post-test) and questionnaire. The mean scores of the students in pre-test was 50, while in post-test the score increased to 72. It can be concluded that mind mapping technique was effective to improve students\u2019 reading comprehension. Then, based on the analysis of questionnaires, most of students gave positive responses on using mind mapping technique while there are some of them who gave negative responses. However there are some of them who still find it difficult to apply mind mapping, but some others find it easy and enjoy applying the technique. By applying mind mapping technique they became more creative.Finally, the writer concludes that mind mapping technique is one of the techniques that can be used in order to improve students\u2019 reading comprehension",

Dette ledet oss til en hypotese om at personalledere i IT-bransjen med lederutdanning ser st\u00f8rre hensikt med strategisk utf\u00f8relse av HR-aktiviteter enn de uten. Derav kommer problemstillingen for oppgaven: \u201cHva betyr utdanningsbakgrunn for personallederes utf\u00f8relse av HR-aktiviteter i norske IT-bedrifter?\u201d Oppgaven tar for seg den enkelte leders tiln\u00e6rming til personallederrollen og HR-aktivitetene. Vi har benyttet kvalitativ metode fordi vi \u00f8nsket \u00e5 f\u00e5 en dypere forst\u00e5else rundt temaet og finne bakenforliggende m\u00f8nstre og \u00e5rsaker til hva som p\u00e5virker HR-arbeidet og betydningen av utdanningsbakgrunn. V\u00e5rt teoretiske rammeverk er basert p\u00e5 teorier og forskning p\u00e5 HR og personalledelse, herunder HR-aktiviteter, strategisk ledelse og lederatferd, noe som har v\u00e6rt grunnlaget i utarbeidelsen av v\u00e5r intervjuguide og for \u00e5 svare p\u00e5 problemstillingen. Funnene i v\u00e5rt utvalg viser at utdanningsbakgrunn har betydning for utf\u00f8relsen av noen HR-aktiviteter, s\u00e6rlig kompetanseutvikling og medarbeidersamtaler, der ledere med lederutdanning har en mer strukturert tiln\u00e6rming til disse enn ledere med fagutdanning eller mindre lederutdanning. I tillegg fant vi at ledere med lederutdanning har st\u00f8rre fokus p\u00e5 bruk av verdier i forbindelse med lederstrategi og har st\u00f8rre kunnskap om betydningen av indre motivasjon. Fagkompetanse og lederkompetanse er i stor grad komplement\u00e6re. I tunge fagmilj\u00f8er er sterk IT-kunnskap n\u00e6rmest forventet av en leder. Imidlertid kan lederutdanning ses p\u00e5 som en indikasjon p\u00e5 lederens interesse for ledelse som fagfelt. Ledere i v\u00e5rt utvalg med lederutdanning er i st\u00f8rre grad opptatt av det organisatoriske. Ledere med mindre formell lederkompetanse er mer opptatt av det faglige og mindre innstilt p\u00e5 \u00e5 ta p\u00e5 seg flere personaloppgaver. Samtidig er lederskap noe som er uavhengig av utdanningsbakgrunn. Erfaringer fra \u00e5 ta ledelse i og utenfor arbeidet er noe som kan gi uformelt l\u00e6ringsutbytte og kan v\u00e6re en p\u00e5virkende faktor til ledertiln\u00e6rming.

The innovation of the technology and the gap of suitable candidates for open positions is the reason to research SNSs. The labour market is changing e.g. demographic changes is the reason to investigate new tools and channels to contact employees and to identify suitable candidates quickly and easily on the most economical basis.  Under these circumstances the human resources management (HRM) is assuming increasing importance. The recruiting process especially influences the competiveness and success of a company. SNSs can give access to potential candidates. The various stakeholders of SNSs have different objectives, interests and benefits with SNSs. The private SNSs and business SNSs have different purposes.  The operations of the mechanism in SNSs have been explained with social capital theory to provide recommendations to organisations. The research tests the theory to find out the usefulness of social capital theory to identify new mechanisms on SNSs and provide a framework to research SNSs and the employment seeking process.  Based on the literature review and theoretical framework qualitative interviews have been carried out. The results of the interviews define variables for the further empirical research and provide a deeper insight. The data of the quantitative survey with more than 900 participants has been analysed with different statistic tools.  The practical aim of the dissertation is to clarify the use of SNSs. The management needs information about SNSs that HRM can use SNSs as a management tool for the recruiting process and understands the mechanism and operations on SNSs which gives a strategic advantage to the organisation. The result of the dissertation is that SNSs have the potential to be used for the employment seeking process. The purpose of the SNS and objectives of the members influence the use and mechanism of SNS. The variable \u201dtrust\u201d, \u201cexchange\u201d and \u201csupport\u201d are key elements for the mechanism of SNSs. Privacy and trust is on a low level on SNSs and they are mainly used to exchange information. The correlation between the use of SNSs with the employment seeking process has weak correlation coefficients",

Vi har benyttet kvalitativ metode fordi vi \u00f8nsket \u00e5 f\u00e5 en dypere forst\u00e5else rundt temaet og finne bakenforliggende m\u00f8nstre og \u00e5rsaker til hva som p\u00e5virker HR-arbeidet og betydningen av utdanningsbakgrunn. V\u00e5rt teoretiske rammeverk er basert p\u00e5 teorier og forskning p\u00e5 HR og personalledelse, herunder HR-aktiviteter, strategisk ledelse og lederatferd, noe som har v\u00e6rt grunnlaget i utarbeidelsen av v\u00e5r intervjuguide og for \u00e5 svare p\u00e5 problemstillingen. Funnene i v\u00e5rt utvalg viser at utdanningsbakgrunn har betydning for utf\u00f8relsen av noen HR-aktiviteter, s\u00e6rlig kompetanseutvikling og medarbeidersamtaler, der ledere med lederutdanning har en mer strukturert tiln\u00e6rming til disse enn ledere med fagutdanning eller mindre lederutdanning. I tillegg fant vi at ledere med lederutdanning har st\u00f8rre fokus p\u00e5 bruk av verdier i forbindelse med lederstrategi og har st\u00f8rre kunnskap om betydningen av indre motivasjon. Fagkompetanse og lederkompetanse er i stor grad komplement\u00e6re. I tunge fagmilj\u00f8er er sterk IT-kunnskap n\u00e6rmest forventet av en leder. Imidlertid kan lederutdanning ses p\u00e5 som en indikasjon p\u00e5 lederens interesse for ledelse som fagfelt. Ledere i v\u00e5rt utvalg med lederutdanning er i st\u00f8rre grad opptatt av det organisatoriske. Ledere med mindre formell lederkompetanse er mer opptatt av det faglige og mindre innstilt p\u00e5 \u00e5 ta p\u00e5 seg flere personaloppgaver. Samtidig er lederskap noe som er uavhengig av utdanningsbakgrunn. Erfaringer fra \u00e5 ta ledelse i og utenfor arbeidet er noe som kan gi uformelt l\u00e6ringsutbytte og kan v\u00e6re en p\u00e5virkende faktor til ledertiln\u00e6rming. Andre variabler som organisasjonens st\u00f8rrelse, organisasjonssystemer og sentralisert HR-avdeling kan ogs\u00e5 ha p\u00e5virkende effekt p\u00e5 hvordan HR-arbeidet blir utf\u00f8rt i hver enkelt bedrift. Vi vil derfor ikke si noe om hva slags effekt variasjoner i personalledernes utf\u00f8relse av HR har p\u00e5 de ansatte",

		"title": "Development of new fault detection methods for rotating machines (roller bearings)",
		"description": "Abstract Early fault diagnosis of roller bearings is extremely important for rotating machines, especially for high speed, automatic and precise machines. Many research efforts have been focused on fault diagnosis and detection of roller bearings, since they constitute one the most important elements of rotating machinery. In this study a combination method is proposed for early damage detection of roller bearing. Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is applied to the collected data for denoising and the resulting clean data are break-down into some elementary components called Intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method. The normalized energy of three first IMFs are used as input for Support vector machine (SVM) to recognize whether signals are sorting out from healthy or faulty bearings. Then, since there is no robust guide to determine amplitude of added noise in EEMD technique, a new Performance improved EEMD (PIEEMD) is proposed to determine the appropriate value of added noise. A novel feature extraction method is also proposed for detecting small size defect using Teager-Kaiser energy operator (TKEO). TKEO is applied to IMFs obtained to create new feature vectors as input data for one-class SVM. The results of applying the method to acceleration signals collected from an experimental bearing test rig demonstrated that the method can be successfully used for early damage detection of roller bearings. Most of the diagnostic methods that have been developed up to now can be applied for the case stationary working conditions only (constant speed and load). However, bearings often work at time-varying conditions such as wind turbine supporting bearings, mining excavator bearings, vehicles, robots and all processes with run-up and run-down transients. Damage identification for bearings working under non-stationary operating conditions, especially for early/small defects, requires the use of appropriate techniques, which are generally different from those used for the case of stationary conditions, in order to extract fault-sensitive features which are at the same time insensitive to operational condition variations. Some methods have been proposed for damage detection of bearings working under time-varying speed conditions. However, their application might increase the instrumentation cost because of providing a phase reference signal. Furthermore, some methods such as order tracking methods still can be applied when the speed variation is limited. In this study, a novel combined method based on cointegration is proposed for the development of fault features which are sensitive to the presence of defects while in the same time they are insensitive to changes in the operational conditions. It does not require any additional measurements and can identify defects even for considerable speed variations. The signals acquired during run-up condition are decomposed into IMFs using the performance improved EEMD method. Then, the cointegration method is applied to the intrinsic mode functions to extract stationary residuals. The feature vectors are created by applying the Teager-Kaiser energy operator to the obtained stationary residuals. Finally, the feature vectors of the healthy bearing signals are utilized to construct a separating hyperplane using one-class support vector machine. Eventually the proposed method was applied to vibration signals measured on an experimental bearing test rig. The results verified that the method can successfully distinguish between healthy and faulty bearings even if the shaft speed changes dramaticall",

		"title": "100 x Ramallah: imaginations, otherness, and (de)colonisation in antispaces of sumud : 1914-2014",
		"description": "100 . Ramallah untersucht die r\u00e4umlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen und zugeh\u00f6rigen Vorstellungen von Stadt(raum) am Beispiel Ramallah \u2013 vom Niedergang des Osmanischen Reichs, \u00fcber das letzte Jahrhundert Anglo- Zionistischer Kolonisierung, bis heute \u2013 und sondiert m\u00f6gliche zuk\u00fcnftige Entwicklungen und Ideen. Die Evolution des spezifischen Raumgef\u00fcges Ramallahs stellt sich dar als Resultat von unterschiedlichen aber dennoch cyclischen Spannungen zwischen hegemonialer Kontrolle einerseits und gegenl\u00e4ufiger Widerstandsbewegungen andererseits. Basierend auf der eingehenden Untersuchung der Gegebenheiten und der Triangulation von morphologischen und territorialen Ver\u00e4nderungen mit sozio-demographischen und wirtschaftspolitischen Faktoren postuliert diese Arbeit drei Hypothesen:\r\n[1] Ramallahs Stadtraum ist das Produkt eines artikulierten kolonialen Projektes, dessen Diskurs enge, homogene Vorstellungen von Ethnie und nationaler Identit\u00e4t propagiert, und sterile, \u00fcberwachte und gesicherte R\u00e4ume hervorgebracht hat. Gleichzeitig beeinflussen heute neoliberale Diskurse die Entwicklung und verstehen die Zielbev\u00f6lkerung weiterhin eher als passiven Empf\u00e4nger, denn als m\u00fcndiger Akteur in der Stadtproduktion. Alternative Vorstellungen von Stadt werden oft als Anomalit\u00e4ten abgelehnt, bek\u00e4mpft und in den seltensten F\u00e4llen umgesetzt. Das Ergebnis war und ist die (absichtliche?) Schaffung eines mutierten Systems mit einer \u00fcber-b\u00fcrokratischen, schlecht angepassten Verwaltung, die regelm\u00e4\u00dfig vers\u00e4umt, Grundlagen zum Erf\u00fcllen sozio\u00f6konomischer Bed\u00fcrfnisse bereitzustellen, und dadurch langfristig Entwicklung und Stabilit\u00e4t zu schaffen. \r\n[2] Die Dialektik des marxistischen Diskurses versteht Stadtraumproduktion als nat\u00fcrlichen (psycho-) \u00f6kologischen Prozess. Aus dieser Perspektive k\u00f6nnen die Post-Oslo-Kontroverse und Frustration in Ramallah auf die Verbitterung angesichts des sozialen \u201eAnderssein\u201c \u2013 \u00fcber normale gro\u00dfst\u00e4dtische Symptome hinaus \u2013 aufgrund des akuten Anstiegs an Unsicherheit (abnehmende Sicherheit), Ungleichheit und r\u00e4umliche Unw\u00fcrde zur\u00fcckgef\u00fchrt werden. Die Kartierung von Verhaltenstendenzen und Bewegungen welche die Wiederherstellung von sumud (soziale Resilienz) zum Ziel haben l\u00e4sst den Schluss zu, dass sich Spannungen \u2013 in Form von verschiedenartiger (meist spontaner) B\u00fcrgermobilisierung \u2013 zwangsl\u00e4ufig entladen werden. Identifizierte Faktoren und wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen deuten auf eine erh\u00f6hte M\u00f6glichkeit von Gewalt hin; ob aufgrund des hohen Grades an Militarisierung und kontroll-fanatischen Nationalstaats-Diskurs, oder der eher generellen (aber untersch\u00e4tzten) Verwundbarkeit gegen\u00fcber (Natur-) Katastrophen. Der Grad und die Auswirkung von Aktivit\u00e4ten von subversiven und klandestinen Sub-Gruppen wiederum h\u00e4ngt von mehreren Faktoren ab; ein entscheidender ist die Art und Weise, in der Stadtraum in den kommenden Jahrzehnten gedacht und produziert werden wird. \r\n[3] St\u00e4dtebau, Stadtplanung und -management werden oft als Tr\u00e4ger von Wohlergehen gesehen und gelten weniger als Katalysator von mentalen und corporealen Krisen. Die zugeh\u00f6rigen Berufsfelder kapitalisieren und katalysieren politische Ideologien, welche antikonformistische Vision\u00e4re einbeziehen/ausschlie\u00dfen in/aus formelle Prozesse der (sozial)r\u00e4umlichen Produktion. Ramallah ist hier keine Ausnahme der neokolonialen Regel: Stadtplaner weisen die Schuld am un-egalit\u00e4ren Urbanismus von sich und verweisen auf ethnischen Unterjochung und Instabilit\u00e4t hin; schaffen es jedoch nicht konstruktive, anwendbare Alternativen zu erarbeiten die m\u00f6gliche Unsicherheiten ber\u00fccksichtigen. In einer Stadt wie Ramallah, wo subjektive Zeitlichkeit st\u00e4ndig neue Risikostrategien und Bev\u00f6lkerungsstr\u00f6me hervorbringt, sind statische Rahmen f\u00fcr indizierte Mechanismen und Hierarchien \u00fcberholt. In Kombination mit den heutigen, digital erm\u00f6glichten, pseudo-konkreten Realit\u00e4ten und dem erh\u00f6hten Grad an Privatisierung, erfordert Ramallahs Resilienz dass die Produktion von R\u00e4umen demokratisiert wird und somit, auf Basis von B\u00fcrgerrechten, R\u00e4ume entkolonialisiert werden. Die zuk\u00fcnftige Form und der Grad der Resilienz / sumud h\u00e4ngen von der F\u00e4higkeit der Bev\u00f6lkerung ab, ihre W\u00fcnsche, Vielfalt, Fluidit\u00e4t und inter-Relevanz zu verr\u00e4umlichen (zu legitimieren). Zu diesem Zweck ist ein Umdenkprozess \u00fcber die Rolle der Bev\u00f6lkerung \u2013 als multipler Akteur und urbanem Vision\u00e4r \u2013 und m\u00f6glicher Interventionsbereiche von Ramallahs wesentlich.\r\nDie Arbeit ist aufgeteilt in sechs Kapitel, beginnend mit den Rahmenbedingungen, r\u00e4umlichem und zeitlichem Hintergrund, und der Erl\u00e4uterung der Hypothesen. Das zweite Kapitel ist darauf fokussiert, die r\u00e4umliche Evolution der Stadt durch Vergleich mit politischen und sozio\u00f6konomischen Elementen nachzuverfolgen und zu verstehen, wobei philosophisch zwischen projizierten (vorgestellten, mentalen) und fundierten (wissenschaftlichen, realen) Bedeutungen, Ideologien, und ihren wirtschaftlichen, sozialen und insbesondere r\u00e4umlichen Spuren und Implikationen differenziert wird. Kapitel drei legt die politisch-\u00f6konomischen Faktoren dar, die Ramallahs r\u00e4umliche Tendenzen in den letzten zwei Jahrzehnten seit der Unterschrift des Osloer Abkommen von 1993 antreiben. Gleichzeitig untersucht die Arbeit die r\u00e4umlich-sozialen Beziehungen und Empfindlichkeiten die diese Diskurse legitimieren und ausreifen lassen. Kapitel vier und f\u00fcnf setzen damit fort, urbane Vorhaben sowohl von privaten als auch von \u00f6ffentlichen Beteiligten zu kartieren; in ihnen enthalten sind die Mandate und Einfl\u00fcsse auf Macht und Entscheidungsfindung; Betriebsmodi, Strukturen und systematische Variablen; die relevantesten Projekte und Engagements; theoretische Genealogien und Vergleichsf\u00e4lle; vorhergesehene r\u00e4umlich-soziale Konsequenzen und die zu Grunde liegenden Chancen. Kapitel sechs schlie\u00dft diese Arbeit, in dem es die Erkenntnisse der vorangegangen Kapitel in variable Vorstellungen von alternativen urbanen Realit\u00e4ten zusammensetzt, die Ramallah potentiell hervorbringen k\u00f6nnte. Durch eine Neuverhandlung der bestehenden kolonialen Morphologie und des zentralisierten, b\u00fcrokratischen Enscheidungssystems, untersucht dieses Kapitel M\u00f6glichkeiten, \u00f6kologisch, wirtschaftlich und politisch resiliente, integrative und fortschrittliche R\u00e4ume f\u00fcr Widerstand und sozialr\u00e4umliche De-Kolonialisierung zu n\u00e4hren. Zum gegenw\u00e4rtigen, kritischen Zeitpunkt \u2013 insbesondere f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4stina, und allgemein f\u00fcr St\u00e4dte mit antikolonialen Revolutionen \u2013 sind Modi der Raumabsorption, Skalierung, Synthese, und Neuvorstellungen von standortspezifischen sozialen Ideologien und Bewegungen essentiell f\u00fcr Lebensqualit\u00e4t und W\u00fcrde. \r\nDie Argumente in dieser Arbeit basieren auf einer Literaturrecherche mit einer Vielzahl von Werken aus verschiedenen Disziplinen, akademische und sonstige. Diese wurden mit empirischen Daten, die in zwanzig qualitativen Interviews, acht Fokusgruppen, Beobachtungen und quantitativen Indikatoren \u2013 welche in acht Feldbesuchen mit einer Gesamtzeit von 32 Wochen und mit durchschnittlich sechs Monaten Abstand gesammelt wurden \u2013 kreuzanalysiert. \r\nNeben der wissenschaftlichen Motivation dieser Arbeit soll diese auch als wissenschaftliches Narrativ dienen, das einige Facetten der aktuellen Polemiken, ge\u00e4u\u00dferten Bestrebungen und intellektuellen Brainstormings \u00fcber Ramallah zusammenf\u00fchrt. Dieser f\u00fcnf Jahre andauernde Prozess hat eine Vielzahl an provozierenden und inspirierenden Unterhaltungen, Debatten, und Versammlungen durchlaufen, und zielt hiermit darauf ab, Konzepte eines aufr\u00fchrerischen Urbanismus darzulegen. \r\nDie hier skizzierten \u00dcberlegungen beanspruchen nicht, unterschiedliche Verst\u00e4ndnisweisen und Interpretationen zu verhindern oder zu limitieren, sondern sollen Aufmerksamkeit auf eine Auswahl an polychromen Aspekten lenken, die einer tieferen Untersuchung bed\u00fcrfen.100 x Ramallah is an investigation of spatial (re-)imagineering of the city of Ramallah, Palestine since the demise of the Osmans and over the past century of Anglo-Zionist colonisation, and an exploration of what could follow. The line of evolution of successive Ramallite spacio-sensibilities transcribes the tensions of nonuniform yet cyclical tides of centralised hegemonic control and counter-resistance. By triangulating morphological and territorial shifts with socio-demographics and politico-economic orders this work argues through three hypotheses. \r\nFirst, Ramallah\u2019s city-space is a product of an articulate colonial project whose discourse promotes narrow homogenised imaginaries of ethnicities and national identities, and therewith sterilised, surveilled and securitized spaces. These concepts have been inducing variations of both, co-optation and opposition. In the same line, neoliberal development discourses continue to infantalize target populations as passive recipients. Hence, these are decisively myopic to the fact that the latter are capable of engendering alternative imaginations, and in cases where these materialise into realities they are rejected and combated as anomalies. The result has been the (intentional?) creation of a mutated system of bureaucratic, incompatible administration that repeatedly fails to provide for basic socioeconomic needs, therewith shared development and stability. In effect, what has been unfolding in Palestine is de-development.\r\nSecond, the dialectic Marxist discourse contends urbanities as natural decodings of psycho-ecological processes. Understood from this perspective, the post-Oslo contestation and frustration in the city can be traced to the exasperation of social otherness beyond regular metropolitan symptoms, due to the acute increase in scales of uncertainty (diminishing securities), inequality and spatial non-dignity. Through mapping the behavioural trend of re-making of sumud (social resilience) it can be concluded that tensions are bound to be released through (mostly ad hoc) techniques and formations of citizen mobilisations. Identified factors and scholarship indicate an elevated possibility of violence; whether due to high levels of militarisation by the nation-state policing discourses or its vulnerability to natural misfortunes. The scales and impacts of clandestine sub-group activities in turn depends on several factors, one of which is the manner by which the city-space will be produced in the coming, critical decades. \r\nThird, urban design, planning, and management are tools often advocated as bearers of welfare and rarely admitted as enablers of mental as well as corporeal crisis. These are professions that by nature capitalise on and catalyse political ideologies which include/exclude anticonformist visionaries in/from formal processes of socio-spatial production. Here Ramallah presents no exception to the neocolonial rule, where its planners (rightfully) blame the failure in forging egalitarian urbanism on racial subjugation and instability, yet fall short of constructively labouring applicable alternatives that account for uncertainty. In cities like Ramallah where subjective temporalities constantly produce new risk-strategies and population flows, static frameworks of indexed mechanisms and hierarchies are rendered obsolete. In combination with today\u2019s digitally-enabled pseudo-concrete realities and heightened levels of privatization; Ramallah\u2019s resilience necessitates that it democratizes spatial production and therewith decolonize its spaces based on concepts of the civic right to flourishing. The future shape and degree of resilience/sumud depend on the ability of the (self-declared) Ramallites to spatialize (grant legitimacy to) their diversity, fluidity, and inter-relevance. To that end, an Umdenkenprozess about the role and range of fields of interventions of Ramallite urban visionaries is quintessential.\r\nThe outline of this work spreads over six chapters, starting with setting the parameters, territorial and temporal back-drop, and elaborates on the hypotheses. The second chapter focuses on tracing and understanding the spatial evolution of the city through cross-comparing those to political and socioeconomic elements; hence philosophically differentiating between projected (imagined, mental) and grounded (scientific, real) meanings, ideologies, and their economic, social and particularly spatial trails and implications. Chapter three expounds on the politico-economic factors fuelling Ramallah\u2019s spatial tendencies in the past two decades since the signature of the Oslo Accords in 1993. It simultaneously investigates the spacio-social relationalities and sensibilities legitimising and incubating these discourses. Chapters four and five proceed to map urban undertakings by both public and private parties (respectively); they feature the power and decision-making mandates and influence; modes of operation, structures and systematic variables; the most relevant projects and engagements; theoretical genealogies and comparative cases; foreseen sociospatial consequences, and; the underlying opportunities. Chapter 6 concludes this work with puzzling the findings of former chapters in variable imaginations of alternative urban realities that Ramallah could potentially produce. Through re-negotiating the existing colonial morphology and centralized, bureaucratic decision-making systems, this chapter explores opportunities for nurturing environmentally, economically and politically resilient, inclusive and progressive spaces of resistance and sociospatial decolonization. In the current critical moment for Palestine specifically and cities featuring anti-colonial revolutions generally; modes of spatial absorption, scaling, synthesis, and reimagineering of locational social ideologies and movements is essential for the quality of life and dignity.\r\nAlong the process arguments are based on scholarly review of a wide range of works from varying disciplines, both academic and otherwise. These were cross-analysed with empirical data collected through twenty qualitative interviews, eight focus groups, observations and quantitative indicators; collected through eight field-visits totalling thirty-two weeks and spanning over intervals of six months in average. \r\nAside the scientific motivations of this work, it desires to serve as a scholarly narrative that coalesces some facets of the momentary polemics, voiced aspirations and intellectual brainstorming about Ramallah. This five-year process has travelled through multitude of provocative and inspiring conversations, debates, and assemblies, and herewith aims at expounding on concepts of insurgent urbanism. The reflections outlined here do not claim premise to foreclosing or limiting differing understandings and interpretations; rather it calls attention to a selection of polychromic aspects requiring deeper investigation",

		"description": "A Research Report submitted in partial fulfilment of the\r\nrequirement for the Degree of Masters of Arts in\r\nDigital Animation at the\r\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand (School of Digital Arts)\r\nJohannesburg, South AfricaIn recent years, the quest for capturing authentic emotion convincingly in computer generated (CG) characters to assist exceedingly complex narrative expressions in modern cinema has intensified. Conveying human emotion in a digital human-like character is widely accepted to be the most challenging and elusive task for even the most skilled animators. Contemporary filmmakers have increasingly looked to complex digital tools that essentially manipulate the visual design of cinema through innovative techniques to reach levels of undetectable integration of CG characters.\r\nIn trying to assess how modern cinema is pursuing the realistic integration of CG human-like characters in digital film with frenetic interest despite the risk of box office failure associated with the uncanny valley, this report focuses on the progress of the advances in the technique of facial motion capture. The uncanny valley hypothesis, based on a theory by Sigmund Freud, was coined in 1970 by Japanese robotics professor, Masahiro Mori. Mori suggested that people are increasingly comfortable with robots the more human-like they appear, but only up to a point. At that turning point, when the robot becomes too human-like,\r\nit arouses feelings of repulsion. When movement is added to this equation, viewers\u2019 sense of the uncanny is heightened when the movement is deemed to be unreal.\r\nMotion capture is the technique of mimicking and capturing realistic movement by utilising technology that enables the process of translating a live actor\u2019s performance into a digital performance. By capturing and transferring the data collected from sensors placed on a body suit or tracked from a high definition video, computer artists are able to drive the movement of a corresponding CG character in a 3-Dimensional (3D) programme. The attention of this study is narrowed to the progress of the techniques developed during a prolific decade for facial motion capture in particular. Regardless of the conflicting discourse surrounding the use of motion capture technology, these phenomenal improvements have allowed filmmakers to overcome that aspect of the uncanny valley associated with detecting realistic movement and facial expression. The progress of facial motion capture is investigated through the lens of selected films released during the period of 2001 to 2012. The two case studies, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Avatar (2009) were chosen for their individual achievement and innovative techniques that introduced new methods of facial capture.\r\nDigital images are said to undermine the reality status of cinematic images by challenging the foundation of long held theories of cinematic realist theory. These theories rooted in the indexical basis of photography, have proved to be the origin of contemporary viewers' notion of cinematic realism. However, the relationship between advanced digital effects and modern cinematic realism has created a perceptual complexity that warrants closer scrutiny. In addressing the paradoxical effect that photo-real cinematic realism is having on the basic comprehension of realism in film, the history of the seminal claims made by recognized realist film theorists is briefly examined",

		"description": "Gamification is a fairly new concept that involves using game elements in non-game contexts. It has been shown that gamification can increase motivation and learning, but there have been conflicting results, with some studies reporting opposite findings. Because of these motivational results and benefits that have been reported, many researchers have attempted to use gamification in educational settings. Again, these studies have shown mixed results. However, as a large number of studies have shown benefits from using gamification in educational settings, it is important to know exactly what aspects of gamification are beneficial so that it can be properly used in second language education. The present study is a meta analysis of gamification of education research that set forth to determine what aspects of gamification are important in educational settings, and how this information can be used to successfully use gamification in second language education. Overall, it was found that gamification typically had a positive effect. Additionally, several moderator variables were of importance, including the length of instruction, inclusion of competitive aspects, and usage of time on task elements",

		"title": "The independent prospective associations of activity intensity and dietary energy density with adiposity in young adolescents",
		"description": "There is limited evidence on the prospective association of time spent in activity intensity (sedentary (SED), moderate (MPA) or vigorous (VPA) activity) and dietary intake with adiposity indicators in young people. This study aimed to assess associations between 1) baseline objectively-measured activity intensity, dietary energy density (DED) and 4-year change in adiposity, and 2) 4-year change in activity intensity/DED, and adiposity at follow-up.  We conducted cohort analyses including 367 participants (10yr at baseline, 14yr at follow-up) with valid data for objectively-measured activity (Actigraph), DED (4-day food diary), anthropometry (waist circumference (WC), %body fat (%BF), fat mass index (FMI), weight status), and covariates. Linear and logistic regression models were fit, including adjustment for DED and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Results showed that baseline DED was associated with change in WC (\u03b2 for 1kJ/g difference: 0.71; 0.26:1.17), particularly in boys (1.26; 0.41:2.16 vs. girls: 0.26: -0.34;0.87), but not with %BF, FMI or weight status.  In contrast, baseline SED, MPA or VPA were not associated with any of the outcomes. Change in DED was negatively associated with FMI (\u03b2 for 1kJ/g increase: -0.86; -1.59:-0.12), and %BF (-0.86; -1.25:-0.11), but not WC (-0.27; -1.02:0.48). Change in SED, MPA and VPA did not predict adiposity at follow-up. In conclusion, activity intensity was not prospectively associated with adiposity, whereas the directions of associations with DED were inconsistent. To inform public health efforts, future work should continue to analyze longitudinal data to further understand the independent role of different energy-balance behaviors in changes in adiposity in early adolescence.We would like to thank the schools, children and parents for their participation in the SPEEDY study.

		"description": "Though Content-based recommender systems proved to have better quality than Collaborative Filtering recommenders, the later is more used because the former suffers from complex mathematical calculations and inadequate data modeling techniques. Using Ontology(ies) to model the data allows machines to better understand both items and users\u2019 preferences and thus not just suggesting better recommendations, but also providing accurate justifications.\r\nIn this work we present a Semantic Recommender system that uses a novel way of generating recommendations depending on a Recommender Ontology that provides controlled vocabularies in the context of recommendations, and that is built upon the idea that not all classes and properties are important from item-similarities point of view. If the domain Ontology is annotated with the Recommender Ontology, the Semantic Recommender should be able to generate recommendations. As a result, the proposed system works with any domain data. Thanks to The Semantic Web standards.\r\nThe proposed mathematical model takes into consideration, in addition to items\u2019 features and users\u2019 profiles, the context of the users and the temporal context, so some items, as an event\u2019s ticket, should never be recommended if the event is over, and should get more presence before the event.\r\nThe Recommender Ontology grants business owners a way to boost the recommended items according to their needs. This guarantees more diversity, which satisfies the business requirements.\r\nFor the experiments, we have tested the proposed solution with many domains including movies, books, music, and with a real business company. We got 55% accuracy when testing on a movie domain though we knew just one feature about the movies. The main limitation we have faced is the absent of a content-based domain case that contains ABox, TBox, and ratings together",

For the past few years, the Grade 12 results have reflected a worrying trend of a high dropout rate at school level and low performance in these gateway subjects. The College of Education at the University of South Africa (Unisa) has started an MIT Community Engagement Project aimed at reversing the high failure rate in the deep rural areas of the disadvantaged schools in the Vhembe district of the Limpopo and North West provinces (NW). With the assistance of the provincial department of education, experts were identified and they signed a two-year contract with Unisa for teaching mathematics and science at these disadvantaged schools over weekends and during the holidays. An honorarium was set aside to compensate for the transport and tuition fees for these experts from dinaledi (stars) schools.

It investigates the challenges its implementation poses for teachers personally and professionally.\r\nThe study is exploratory and interpretive and is based on the perceptions of 12 male teachers; 6 Arab teachers of English and 6 \u201cnative\u201d English speaking teachers at 3 boys\u2019 public high schools in the Abu Dhabi emirate. Data were gathered through lengthy semi-structured interviews with teachers, analysis of Adec curriculum and assessment documentation as well as open, non-participant classroom observations.\r\nThe findings show the current curriculum, modelled on that used in NSW mainstream schools in Australia up until the end of 2014 is an inappropriate choice for students learning English as a foreign/second language in a school environment where all other subjects are taught in Arabic. This in turn provides a range of challenges for teachers who are unable to implement the course content as it was intended or the learner / learning-centred pedagogical approaches promoted by the curriculum and assessment documentation.\r\nThe study recommends a realistic assessment of students\u2019 language needs be undertaken as a top priority and, based on these findings, English classes streamed according to students\u2019 language proficiency; with curriculum and assessment designed to reflect the various stages of learning.  Ability grouping would enable specialist teachers to target areas of strength and weakness, thus countering the boredom and frustration currently experienced by many students.

		"description": "In this world of Internet, there is a rapid amount of growth in data both in terms of size and dimension. It consists of web pages that represents human thoughts. These thoughts involves concepts and associations which we can capture. Using mathematics, we can perform meaningful clustering of these pages. This project aims at providing a new problem solving paradigm known as algebraic topology in data science. Professor Vasant Dhar, Editor-In-Chief of Big Data (Professor at NYU) define data science as a generalizable extraction of knowledge from data. The core concept of semantic based search engine project developed by my team is to extract a high frequency finite sequence of keywords by association mining. Each frequent finite keywords sequences represent a human concept in a document set. The collective view of such a collection concepts represent a piece of human knowledge. So this MS project is a data science project. By regarding each keyword as an abstract vertex, a finite sequence of keywords becomes a simplex, and the collection becomes a simplicial complexes. Based on this geometric view, new type of clustering can be performed here. If two concepts are connected by n-simplex, we say that these two simplex are connected. Those connected components will be captured by Homology Theory of Simplicial Complexes. The input data for this project are ten thousand files about data mining which are downloaded from IEEE explore library. The search engine nowadays deals with large amount of high dimensional data. Applying mathematical concepts and measuring the connectivity for ten thousand files will be a real challenge. Since, using algebraic topology is a complete new approach. Therefore, extensive testing has to be performed to verify the results for homology groups obtained",

		"title": "Teachers' perceptions of behavioural problems manifested by Grade 11 and 12 learners in three Namibian schools",
		"description": "In Namibia today few learners with behavioural and learning problems are within special schools as most are placed within the mainstream school system. Placing these learners within the mainstream system is part of the policy of Inclusive Education (IE) because it argues that this would benefit these learners and also save resources. IE is concerned with addressing barriers to learning and behavioural problems are regarded as one of these barriers. IE argues for a series of new approaches to the diagnosis and response to learners with behavioural problems. This poses challenges for teachers in mainstream schools. Teachers are at the forefront of this situation as they are usually the first to observe and experience the behavioural problems in the schools and are expected to respond appropriately. They find this situation both challenging and problematic. This research explores a sample of teachers\u2019 perceptions of learners\u2019 behavioural problems. To collect in-depth information, this study followed a qualitative approach with a case study design. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews, supplemented with observation and document analysis. The study consisted of fifteen respondents: three principals, three teacher counsellors and nine teachers from the three selected schools. This study illuminates the types of behaviour that teachers encounter, the impact of these behaviours, the factors seen as contributing to these behaviours, and how teachers and the school system deal with these behaviours. In addition the study applies Bronfenbrenner\u2019s bioecological model (1992) to explain how the behaviours manifested by Grade 11 and 12 learners, and identified as problematic by teachers, are part of an interconnected nested social system. The results from the study indicate the manifestation of behavioural problems to be common occurrences in secondary schools are evident, amongst others, through fighting, bullying, substance abuse, truancy, and disrespect of teachers and authority. The teachers pointed to the prevalence of these problems as well as the serious impact such problems have on these learners, their fellow learners, and on the teachers. The teachers identified a complex array of what they saw as contributing factors located within the school, peer groups, family and home circumstances, the local community, as well within the national education policy, the economy and society. The study points to some specific, as well as broader, lessons and opportunities for action both for those managing the education system at the national level and for schools and teachers",

		"description": "The education system in Namibia was shaped by the policies located within the framework of the apartheid ideology. Since it gained its independence in 1990, the government positioned education at the top of the national priorities. Thus, there has been a growing realisation of the importance of more democratic forms of leadership in the education system for the country to be able to cater for a democratic society. Amongst others, teachers became active creators and managers of the learning outcomes. In addition, teachers are regarded as agents of change and the driving force for productive teaching and learning. Literature describes how the management in schools has been redistributing authority and power so that a culture of teacher leadership in school communities can grow. More importantly, school improvement depends more on the active involvement of teacher leaders as it is realised that people in formal positions cannot do everything. In this line this study investigated the understanding of teachers and members of management of teacher leadership practice and it further identified the structural and cultural factors which enabled and inhibited this practice in a primary school. This study is a case study of a Primary school in a semi-urban area of Otjozondjupa Region, a central part of Namibia. This study was conducted in the interpretive paradigm and it is a qualitative case in nature, employing semi-structured interviews, observation and document analysis. Triangulation over the data revealed that respondents have an understanding of the concept and that all teachers are involved in leadership roles at school which are more strongly found in the classroom and through involvement with other teachers. Teacher leadership roles at the case study school also occur within the whole school with some limitations and also extend beyond the school. Grant\u2019s (2008) model of teacher leadership was used to analyse the data. The study suggested some hindrances and supporting factors of teacher leadership. The findings suggested that teacher leadership is understood at the case study school and that they experienced factors that enabled and hindered this practice at different stages. Enabling factors included the school structure, further studies and workshops attended, while teacher leadership is impeded by teachers\u2019 unwillingness to collaborate with others and the platoon system. The study recommends future large scale studies, including at secondary schools, so that a broader sense of teacher leadership may emerge",

This initiative was launched in 2010 by the Centre of Talented Youth, Ireland (CTYI) in order to address the under-representation of high-ability second-level students from low-income families within CTYI\u2019s older student summer programmes.\n\nThe need for this programme, and in turn, for such research developed out of an awareness regarding the under-representation of students from areas of disadvantage within programmes focusing on the development of academic talent at CTYI (and within the field of gifted education). In addition, there was a general perception that these young people are less likely to take part in higher education upon completion of their secondary school studies.\n\nThe study applies a qualitative case study methodology and uses of a number of research methods, (questionnaires, interviews, & focus groups) with different sets of research participants (students, parents & schools) and across a number of years (2011-2014). The research findings indicate four key themes; academic, social, and personal benefits together with a small number of negative consequences. This case addresses a deficit in the literature which calls for strategies focusing on the talent development of high-ability, low-income students through the presentation of a detailed description of this innovative programme. The findings from this case study provide important lessons about this population of students which may provide readers with valuable insights should the programme be replicated in the future",

This master thesis focus at the challenges within phrase searching in large text indexes, and to assess alternative approaches to cope with such indexes. This goal was achieved by performing an experiment, based on the theory of using bigrams consisting of stopwords as additional index terms. Realizing the characteristics within inverted index structures, we utilized stopwords as indicators for severe long posting lists. The characteristics of stopwords proved valuable, and they were collected based on a already  established index for a subset of the TREC GOV2 collection. In alternative approaches we outlined two  state of the art  index structures, speci\ufb01cally designed to cope with phrase searching challenges. The \ufb01rst structure - nextword index - followed a modi\ufb01cation of the inverted index structure. The second structure - phrase index - utilized the inverted structure in using complete phrases as index terms. Our bigram index focused on the same manipulation of the inverted index structure as the phrase index, using bigrams of words to rastically cut posting lists lengths.

		"description": "The focus of this research was to establish how black primary school principals in some Port Elizabeth schools manage the problems of poverty, vandalism and non-payment of school fees. The aim of this research was to improve these burning issues at my own school, but also to assist other schools which are encountering similar problems with regard to these three issues. Qualitative research methods were used. Data was collected by studying relevant literature and conducting semi-structured interviews and participant observation. Composite case studies of the schools were compiled. Content analysis was used to analyse the data and recommendations for improvement were made. The results of the research indicate that since 1994, when democracy and equal human rights were declared, primary schools have actually been experiencing escalating problems in terms of poverty, vandalism and school fee payment. As the school system is closely intertwined with the socio-economic and political dimensions of society, these challenges can only be effectively addressed if all stakeholders in education collectively take up ownership of these problems and commit themselves to finding unique and effective solutions in the Port Elizabeth urban and rural areas",

		"title": "An Architectural Approach to Autonomics and Self-management of Automotive Embedded Electronic Systems",
		"description": "International audienceEmbedded electronic systems in vehicles are of rapidly increasing commercial importance for the automotive industry. While current vehicular embedded systems are extremely limited and static, a more dynamic configurable system would greatly simplify the integration work and increase quality of vehicular systems. This brings in features like separation of concerns, customised software configuration for individual vehicles, seamless connectivity, and plug-and-play capability. Furthermore, such a system can also contribute to increased dependability and resource optimization due to its inherent ability to adjust itself dynamically to changes in software, hardware resources, and environment condition. This paper describes the architectural approach to achieving the goals of dynamically self-configuring automotive embedded electronic systems by the EU research project DySCAS. The architecture solution outlined in this paper captures the application and operational contexts, expected features, middleware services, functions and behaviours, as well as the basic mechanisms and technologies. The paper also covers the architecture conceptualization by presenting the rationale, concerning the architecture structuring, control principles, and deployment concept. In this paper, we also present the adopted architecture V&V strategy and discuss some open issues in regards to the industrial acceptance",

		"description": "Aims:  The primary aim of this randomised-controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of an exercise consultation (experimental condition) compared with standard exercise information (control condition) on maintenance of physical activity six and 12 months following completion of a phase III hospital-based exercise programme. Secondary aims included assessing the effect of an exercise consultation compared with exercise information on physiological and psychological variables at six and 12 months.\n\nConclusions:  This study demonstrated that the exercise consultation was more effective than exercise information in maintaining self-reported physical activity for 12 months after completion of a phase III exercise programme. However, the change in CSA accelerometer readings over the 12-month study period did not parallel the significant decrease in self-reported physical activity observed in the control group. The exercise consultation was not effective in maintaining exercise capacity for 12 months after completion of phase III.  Significant decreases in peak VO2 from baseline to 12 months were observed in both groups. In contrast, an improvement in the VO2 at the lactate threshold, which is an index of submaximal endurance capacity, was recorded in the experimental group compared to the control group from baseline to follow-up. Finally, the exercise consultation had no significant effect on processes of exercise behaviour change, lipid profile and psychological function. These variables were normal at baseline and were maintained over the study period in both groups.  The results of this study demonstrate that the exercise consultation may be an effective intervention for maintaining physical activity after completion of phase III hospital-based exercise programmes.  The exercise consultation is a minimal intervention that could be delivered by physiotherapists to patients at the end of phase III or by British Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation (BACR) trained exercise instructors to patients in phase IV",

		"description": "The current study investigates instructional design factors that can be manipulated to enhance learner motivation. A goal-based approach to enhancing motivation is discussed, along with current theory concerning the goal orientation an individual learner brings to an instructional situation. The efficacy of Prospect Theory as a cognitive mechanism underlying the valuation of effort toward a goal is discussed, and an experiment is presented in which goal messaging is manipulated based on the predictions of Prospect Theory as well as Goal Setting Theory. A Web-based tutorial consisting of ten sections of text, each with a recall test, was used. An ability goal orientation was found to impact section quiz scores. Both goal message framing and goal difficulty level were found to interact with an ability goal orientation to impact performance on section quizzes. A learning goal orientation was found to interact with goal difficulty to impact section quiz scores. The author concludes that while the study supports the use of goal messaging to enhance motivation, such manipulations by educators must be made in light of the goal orientations a learner brings to the instructional setting",

		"title": "Bridging the gap: user centred design and support methods for decision support systems in crop production",
		"description": "This thesis suggests that there is a problem with technology transfer in crop production.\nThe nature of the problem and the mechanisms available to the agricultural research\nsector for solving it are examined. As a consequence it is argued that Decision Support\nSystems (DSS) technology is an extremely useful mechanism for encapsulating and\ndelivering scientific knowledge to the industry. The thesis then poses the question of\nwhy this technology is not currently being taken up by farmers and farm consultants,\nhypothesising that the current lack of user involvement in design is a major contributing\nfactor. The hypothesis is supported by a survey of DSS development and use in\nagriculture and it is concluded that a user-centred design (UCD) approach is important\nto the successful adoption of these systems by the industry.\nThe thesis then asks what methods the agricultural DSS developers should employ to\nensure a user-centred design approach. It is suggested that it is not sufficient merely to\npoint DSS producers in the direction of user centred design but to furnish them with\nadequate methods and tools to achieve this goal, bearing in mind their specific\nrequirements and limitations and the nature of the decision support task. A review of\ncurrently available methods reveals that none of the standard methods meets this\nrequirement and that a new approach is therefore needed. An approach supported by\nwork from management science is introduced. This approach identifies the user's\nquestions to the system as a means of defining its function and features. Its use in the\ncontext of workshops is developed into a user centred design method to meet all of the\nrequirements for the designer stakeholders. The question approach is also used as the\nbasis of \u00e4 method for identifying DSS interface requirements and collating design\nsolutions. Both methods are presented as mechanisms for improving the acceptance of\nDSS in the sector. The document concludes by discussing the contribution made by the\nthesis to its originating disciplines and looks forward to the future of DSS technology in\ncrop production",

		"description": "Computer technology has become an integral part of instruction at the elementary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Some instructors have enthusiastically adopted technological innovations in their classrooms, often expending their own funds for hardware and software, while others have resisted the trend, citing a myriad of reasons for not including computer technology. Significant research on the adoption of innovations has been undertaken by Everett M. Rogers, who identified individuals on a continuum from Innovator to Laggard. Rogers\u2019 research was used as a basis to classify full-time faculty teaching in degree programs in the North Carolina Community College System and to compare these faculty members on five demographic variables. While faculty did not differ on age, gender or race/ethnicity, they did differ regarding their years of teaching experience and highest degree attained.\nFaculty in the North Carolina Community College were further identified as either users or non-users of computer technology in instruction and were analyzed on the same five demographic characteristics as were evaluated with the Rogers continuum. No differences were found in any of the five categories. Faculty members who reported employing technology for instruction often utilized multiple techniques, such as e-mail contact with students, posting assignments and other information on course websites, and using course management software for recordkeeping functions. Non-users identified a number of reasons for not incorporating technology into instruction, as well as which strategies might be employed to encourage them to adopt computer technology into instruction. Faculty classified as users or non-users of computer technology in instruction identified the presence of technology change agents in their organizations, and stated that other faculty members, or the president or other members of senior administration filled these roles",

		"title": "Design attributes of educational computer software for optimising girls' participation in educational game playing",
		"description": "Recent research on girls in science education in Australian primary schools indicates a participation rate lower than that of boys. This inequality could lead subsequently to reduced opportunities for girls entering the workforce in their adult years. Many studies have attempted to reveal why this situation has arisen and a variety of strategies for increasing girls' participation has been suggested. A relatively new strategy that does not appear frequently in the research literature is the use of educational computer game software. An important question arises: does the game software used in primary school science education reflect design attributes favoured by boys and, if so, do these attributes actively discourage girls' participation by making them feel uncomfortable or stressed? My case study was designed to identify design features of computer games that girls prefer so that these features can be included in educational computer game software designed for science education, as well as the other Key Learning Areas. Through interviews, surveys and observations my interpretive study obtained the opinions and views of over 200 children in two suburban Australian primary schools in which I work as a teacher-librarian. In this role I purchase educational computer games and organize special classes for students to play them. From my analysis of the data I make recommendations that reflect girls' preferred design attributes for educational computer games. I also generate a checklist of criteria from my interpretations that may result in the purchase of software that could not only enhance girls' participation and success in primary school science, the curriculum area of greatest personal interest to me, but also in other Key Learning Areas of primary education.",

		"description": "Recent studies suggest the importance of examining cumulative risk or advantage as potential predictors of health over the life course. Researchers investigating the cumulative health effects of education, however, have mainly conceptualized education in years or degrees, often disregarding educational quality and access to educational opportunities that may place individuals on divergent academic trajectories. We investigate whether educational advantages in youth are associated with an individual\\u27s health trajectory. We develop a novel index of educational advantage and employ random-intercept modeling using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We find a widening health disparity in adulthood between respondents with greater and those with fewer educational advantages in youth. Further, among respondents with few educational advantages, blacks experience a greater health burden as they age compared to whites and Hispanics. These results suggest that differential access to educational advantages during youth may contribute to persisting health disparities in adulthood",

		"title": "Breaking the ice : Qallunaat teachers' journeys to Nunavik",
		"description": "This inquiry focuses on Qallunaat (non-native) teachers' perceptions of their lived experiences teaching and learning in the arctic region of Nunavik, Quebec, Canada. Academic underachievement of Inuit children and high drop out rates in northern schools are a great concern for every community. An important contributing factor to the lack of academic success of Inuit children is the high turnover rate of Qallunaat teachers. Social distancing, isolation and cultural dislocation are major problems that many southern teachers find difficult to confront. Through a year-long Action Research Project in Nunavik focusing on eight Qallunaat teachers, I used a narrative inquiry to explore these teachers' shifting perceptions of their experiences as they attempted to adapt to their Inuit host community. Data confirms that without appropriate preparation and support, Qallunaat teachers perceive that they face overwhelming challenges educating Inuit youth and building relationships with Inuit community members. During my work in this northern community, I observed how these teachers seeking direction within such significant cross-cultural tensions, were confronted with profound existential issues. I examined why their southern perceptions and their northern experiences made them question some fundamental values that are at the core of their identities. I used an interdisciplinary dialogical post-colonial framework to situate these Qallunaat teacher voices in the educational contexts of Nunavik. By listening to these teachers, I began to understand how conflicts in identity arose when teachers' attitudes did not match their perceptions of their positionings in their host community. Methods included formal and informal conversations, individual and group interviews, photovoice and journals. I found that Qallunaat teachers can contribute to the North if they learn to position themselves as compassionate observers and listeners. Through dialogue, Qallunaat teachers can create shared spaces to better understand the particular needs of Inuit community members and consider alternatives and solutions. I provide recommendations to the Kativik School Board that might better prepare and support Qallunaat teachers. This study has direct implications for policy regarding pre-service and in-service education for educators within the Kativik School Board, Quebec Ministry of Education and the McGill Faculty of Education",

		"description": "The role of the chief information officer (CIO) has become increasingly challenging and complex as information\n\ncommunications technology (ICT) has become critical infrastructure for most large organisations. However,\n\nthere has been a lack of research which has empirically examined the role of the modern CIO. A set of initial\n\ncritical competencies were identified in the existing literature. An online survey of CIOs confirmed the\n\nimportance of these competencies and identified other competencies which are considered critical. The key\n\nfindings show that the role of the modern CIO has become increasingly business focused and strategic. Soft\n\nskills dominate the critical competencies. Ultimately, how a CIO leads and manages his/her ICT staff will\n\ngreatly influence how successful a CIO is in the role. However, the CIO still needs to have high level\n\nunderstanding of key technology knowledge so personal knowledge of or access to hard skills is also critical in\n\nthe role",

		"description": "Thesis (Master)--Izmir Institute of Technology, Computer Engineering, Izmir, 2005Includes bibliographical references (leaves: 147)Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxv, 201 leavesDuring the recent years, the rapid growth of the Web and multimedia technologies urged a shift of Computer-Based Educational Technology towards the Web. In the leading universities of the developed countries, studies on Web-Based Education have started and in an increasing manner are going strong. In the last few years, the leading universities of Turkey are also greatly interested in Web-Based Education and have started their re-structuring accordingly.The goal of this study is to design a basic model to be utilized by a university aiming to offer web-based distance education. In achieving this; by the use of system approach, a model comprising of three subsystems, namely system analysis, system design and evaluation&control, working in coordination with each other, has been tried to be proposed. There may be only one missing point of this study, that is; since preparing a lesson or program according to this model was not foreseen in this thesis, the effectiveness evaluations suggested in the evaluation&control subsystem could not be realized. It is recommended to realize such an evaluation in a further study to make it possible to reveal the effectiveness of web-based education by preparing a lesson or program according to this model.On the other hand, a survey has been conducted in Turkey in some of the universities either offering web-based education or are interested in studies in this field.The aim of this survey is to analyze from system design point of view the studies carried out in our universities on this matter and to get a picture of the existing situation.The directed questions aiming this were prepared by taking into consideration of the three stages of system design subsystem, i.e. administrative design, educational design, and technological design. It is intended for the result of this survey to shed light to the new-coming institutions in this field. As a matter of fact, each stage of this subsystem is a survey item itself and should be researched one by one in other studies.Furthermore, for individuals interested in distance education and web-based distance education and for people newly involved in this matter, this thesis is intended to be a reference material and to serve this purpose the sections are prepared containing the basic information accordingly. Nevertheless, since most of the information regarding system design are prepared without taking into consideration the disabled people, the relevant information are not complete. In another study, the offering of the web-based education to the disabled people, especially for deaf, hard of hearing or speech impaired, and blind students, has to be investigated.Finally, in this thesis the proposed model for the Web-Based Distance Education, as being a basic and conceptual model, has a flexible structure; i.e., suitable for all the institutions and establishments intending to offer the web-based education.What is important here, is to exploit the potential sources within the institution that will display the required systematic approach",

		"title": "An evaluation of the initial scientific field teacher education programme in the colleges of education, Oman",
		"description": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initial teacher education programme which\n\nis specifically offered by four Omani colleges of education to prepare \"scientific field\"\n\nfemale teachers to teach science and mathematics subjects for pupils in Basic Education\n\nschools (Grades 1-4), ages of students from (6-10). This evaluation questions the\n\nadequacy of this programme to prepare qualified teachers to teach these subjects in a\n\nchanging school system implementing a reformed Basic Education curriculum and\n\nprogramme. This system tends to transfer the teaching and learning process from the\n\ntraditional learning environment to one that is a constructivist teaching environment. This\n\nstudy focuses on this programme's defined teaching competencies and to what extent the\n\nparticipants perceived themselves properly trained with respect to these listed\n\ncompetencies in their professional practices. The study also spotlights student teachers'\n\nand practicing teachers' attitudes and motivation towards the teaching profession, and\n\ntowards aspects of science and mathematics teaching in primary schools. The study tried\n\nto examine the extent of the constructivist approaches by student teachers and practicing\n\nteachers in their science and mathematics lessons. The evaluation framework of the study was designed to conduct the research plan and to\n\nachieve its purposes. Several evaluation models were examined and they were critically\n\nreviewed. The review concluded that there is no one specific model which can be\n\nconsidered (the most) outstanding in terms of excellence, the selection of the evaluation\n\nmodel depends on factors such as the aim of the study, the nature of the programme, its\n\ncontext, and the targeted population, Thus the study constructed of three stages with\n\nfindings from conducted evaluation instruments of each stage leading consequently to the\n\nnext stage. In the first stage both questionnaires and semi-structured interviews are\n\nimplemented. while observations with a checklist followed by follow-up interviews are\n\nconducted to gather information during the second stage. In the third stage, conversational\n\nopen interviews are proceeded. Although the group focused upon for the study are the\n\nfirst stakeholders (the student teachers and practicing teachers), the research was extended\n\nto get information from other participants, educators from different positions, such as\n\ncurriculum advisors, college lecturers, inspectors, head teachers and senior teachers.\n\nThe findings from this study indicated that in general, participants' considered of the\n\nimportance of the some of the listed competencies. Even though there is some consensus\n\nof the importance for these competencies, there are some un-ignorable critics who view\n\nthese competencies as being far away from the goals for the preparation of scientific field teachers for the reformed Basic Education schools, most of the listed competencies are\n\nsupposed to be the foundations of the programme's components, and thus the colleges of\n\neducation's courses are far too general. Findings from the questionnaire show that student\n\nteachers and practicing teachers amplified their self-rating of competence in the listed\n\ncompetencies because responses from the face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with\n\nthem found divergence views. These differing views were supported by interviewed\n\nteacher educators and principals, and their opinions towards the insufficiency of the\n\ngraduates of the colleges of education. The study found from the observations of some of\n\nthe practicing teachers and student teachers observed while teaching science and\n\nmathematics lessons, and from the follow-up interviews, that there is very little sign of\n\nconstructivist teaching approaches used in these lessons.\n\nThe study proposes recommendations which can improve and strengthen the preparation\n\nof cycle one scientific field teachers at the pre-service level and to future in-service so\n\nthat teachers might better meet the range of work and responsibilities they are facing in\n\nthe reformed Basic Education schools. Finally, it recommends areas for further research",

		"description": "The purpose of this case study was to understand governance of higher education in the developing country of Belize by examining how governance affects financial and curricular decision-making in higher education in Belize. The study also examined the role of the market in higher education and its effects on curricular and financial decision-making in higher education. Data were collected from higher education administrators and Ministry of Education officials through semi-structured interviews, and from review of institutional and public documents related to higher education. A major finding of this study is that although the Ministry of Education through the Tertiary and Post Secondary Services Unit is responsible for the supervision and development of the higher education system, there is a lack of expertise in this  Unit .\nThe lack of expertise means that there is no one who can advise the Ministry of Education in respect to the direction or development of higher education. The study also revealed that there is a lack of an adequate funding formula to support the University of Belize and the junior colleges. While the junior colleges receive only salary grants, UB receives a yearly subvention for capital and recurring expenditures. The lack of a funding formula to include capital projects stifles the infrastructural development of the institution and affects the quality of education offered. The study also revealed that there is a lack of a national development plan to assist institutions in identifying academic programs that meet national development needs. As a result, academic programs are often identified based on market needs, perceived community needs, and social and religious needs depending on the religious affiliation of the institution.\nAnother finding of the study is the role of the market in higher education in Belize. The market plays or should play a role in guiding higher education in Belize, but there is a need for policies and measures to be instituted to lessen the effects of the market. Also, while competition among institutions is necessary because of the small size of the higher education system, collaboration is even more crucial",

		"description": "This inquiry explored one group of teachers\\u27 experiences in an innovative professional development opportunity, known as Book Talk, and its implications for understanding and defining professional development. This study further examined professional development and its relationship with the school\\u27s organizational structure. A qualitative, teacher research methodology, with a phenomenological orientation framed this inquiry Book Talk was a site-based, teacher-directed initiative designed to break isolation and develop collegiality among teachers. The Book Talk model of professional development promoted a collaborative environment, in which teachers developed trust to share and work together to inquire about children\\u27s literature. The participating teachers recognized that when time was provided for professional development and professional development was directed by teachers, significant implications for collegiality, learning, and change evolved. The collaborative model of Book Talk supported the new paradigm of professional development that promotes collegial interaction, continuous learning, and building a community of teachers who are both learners and experts. Book Talk teachers reported that significant professional development is limited in the current organization of schools because social, political, cultural, and structural influences invade the professional context of teachers and can impede professional development. These influences surround the teachers\\u27 understandings that: (1) Teachers work in isolation; (2) Teachers are pressured by time; (3) Teachers are subordinates, thus outsiders of the educational context control teachers, their work, their knowledge, and their development; (4) Teachers teach from mandates and prescriptions, thereby automating teachers\\u27 practice; (5) Teachers are expected to meet society\\u27s demands, hence teachers\\u27 roles are expanding; (6) Teachers lack power, and in return teachers\\u27 voices are silenced and teachers are ignored in the educational context. Findings of this inquiry indicate that several changes must occur to enable teachers to assume a greater role in the professional development context: (1) A change in relations of power in the educational context, (2) A structural change in schools, teaching, and learning, (3) A change in the organizational schedule of the teaching day, and (4) A change towards teacher-generated learning for all teachers\u2014veteran teachers and future candidates",

The results of the research indicate that the Hazards of Place model of vulnerability provides a reasonably accurate portrayal of emergency practitioners understanding of vulnerability, although some additional variables that influence vulnerability were introduced. Throughout this research, emphasis on building community and individual resilience was also promoted as a key factor in reducing the human and economic losses associated with disaster events. This led to an enhanced version of the \u2018Hazards of Place\u2019 model which recognized the layered and dynamic processes of vulnerability and resilience. Through this, a new understanding of the overall place resiliency was presented which merges the vulnerability and resilience literature to create a new understanding of the relationship between these two concepts",

One area of robotics that is readily available for technology integration into elementary and middle school science and technology classrooms is produced by LEGO \u00ae (Mindstorms for Schools\u2122). Such technology offers the possibility to teach various scientific, mathematical, and design concepts through the designing, building, and programming of robots. Students can creatively explore computer programming, mechanical design, physics, mathematics, motion, environmental factors, and problem solving in a collaborative group setting. This paper describes phases of a case study that integrated LEGO robotic technology into computer and science middle school classroom environments. Data were collected in the form of student projects, reflective journals, observations, and video. Observational results indicate that students had more success during robot building and programming tasks when they used flowcharting to help scaffold their knowledge construction",

		"description": "In this thesis we study a problem that arises in answering boolean queries submitted to a search engine.   Usually a search engine stores the set of IDs of documents containing each word in a pre-computed sorted order and to evaluate a query like \"computer AND science\" the search engine has to evaluate the union of the sets of documents containing the words \"computer\" and \"science\".   More complex queries will result in more complex set expressions.   In this thesis  we consider the problem of evaluation of a set expression with union and intersection as operators and ordered sets as operands.       We explore properties of comparison-based algorithms for the  problem.   A proof of a set expression is the set of comparisons that a comparison-based algorithm performs before it can determine the result of the expression.   We discuss the properties of the proofs of set expressions and based on how complex the smallest proofs of a set expression E are, we define a measurement for determining how difficult it is for E to be computed.   Then, we design an algorithm that is adaptive to the difficulty of the input  expression and we show that the running time of the algorithm is roughly proportional to difficulty of the input expression, where the factor is roughly logarithmic in the number of the operands of the input expression",

		"title": "Effect of an exercise consultation on maintenance of physical activity after completion of phase III exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation",
		"description": "Aims:  The primary aim of this randomised-controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of an exercise consultation (experimental condition) compared with standard exercise information (control condition) on maintenance of physical activity six and 12 months following completion of a phase III hospital-based exercise programme. Secondary aims included assessing the effect of an exercise consultation compared with exercise information on physiological and psychological variables at six and 12 months.\n\nConclusions:  This study demonstrated that the exercise consultation was more effective than exercise information in maintaining self-reported physical activity for 12 months after completion of a phase III exercise programme. However, the change in CSA accelerometer readings over the 12-month study period did not parallel the significant decrease in self-reported physical activity observed in the control group. The exercise consultation was not effective in maintaining exercise capacity for 12 months after completion of phase III.  Significant decreases in peak VO2 from baseline to 12 months were observed in both groups. In contrast, an improvement in the VO2 at the lactate threshold, which is an index of submaximal endurance capacity, was recorded in the experimental group compared to the control group from baseline to follow-up. Finally, the exercise consultation had no significant effect on processes of exercise behaviour change, lipid profile and psychological function. These variables were normal at baseline and were maintained over the study period in both groups.  The results of this study demonstrate that the exercise consultation may be an effective intervention for maintaining physical activity after completion of phase III hospital-based exercise programmes.  The exercise consultation is a minimal intervention that could be delivered by physiotherapists to patients at the end of phase III or by British Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation (BACR) trained exercise instructors to patients in phase IV",

This is a true copy of the thesis, including any required final revisions, as accepted by my examiners. I understand that my thesis may be made electronically available to the public. In this thesis we study a problem that arises in answering boolean queries submitted to a search engine. Usually a search engine stores the set of IDs of documents containing each word in a pre-computed sorted order and to evaluate a query like \u201ccomputer AND science \u201d the search engine has to evaluate the union of the sets of documents containing the words \u201ccomputer \u201d and \u201cscience\u201d. More complex queries will result in more complex set expressions. In this thesis we consider the problem of evaluation of a set expression with union and intersection as operators and ordered sets as operands. We explore properties of comparison-based algorithms for the problem. A proof of a set expression is the set of comparisons that a comparison-based algorithm performs before it can determine the result of the expression. We discuss the properties of the proofs of set expressions and based on how complex the smallest proofs of a set expression E are, we define a measurement for determining how difficult it is for E to be computed. Then, we design an algorithm that is adaptive to the difficulty of the input expression and we show that the running time of the algorithm is roughly proportional to difficulty of the input expression, where the factor is roughly logarithmic in the number of the operands of the input expression. Key words: Adaptive algorithm, comparison-based algorithm, search engines, algorithms",

		"description": "This paper explores the extent to which the peer-to-peer (p2p) file-sharing of music is a form of communication protected from the restrictions of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (U.K) (CDPA) by the guarantee offree expression enshrined in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and incorporated into domestic law through the Human Rights Act 1998 (UK) (HRA). The paper first examines the protection offered to freedom of expression through the existing copyright scheme. It is asserted that due to a lack of context-sensitivity, mechanisms such as the idea-expression dichotomy must not be relied upon to deny the existence of prima facie breaches of Article 10(1) of the ECHR. Rather, such breaches must be acknowledged and justified (if possible) as being  necessary in a democratic society  under Article 10(2) of the ECHR. Next, the extent to which p2p music file-sharing represents an infringement under the terms of the CDPA (exclusive of any effect of the ECHR) is examined. It is concluded that such sharing does amount to an infringement under the Act and is not subject to any of the enumerated defences. The final part of the paper explores the extent to which the statutory restriction on file-sharing of music may be permitted under Article 10 of the ECHR. It is suggested that, for a number of reasons, the CDPA\\u27s restriction on free expression may not be  necessary in a democratic society  under Article 10(2) of the ECHR. As a result, should this statutory restriction be impugned in a UK courtroom in the context of p2p music file-sharing, such a court may be under an obligation to exculpate infringing parties under the  public interest  defence or to make a declaration of incompatibility under the HRA",

Rather than examining whether it is possible to enforce regulation on such a media, this paper addresses two additional fundamental questions: (1) what do regulatory discourses and attempts to regulate reveal about the nation-state\\u27s political authority under globalization, and (2) how does this authority vary across social, political, and cultural contexts? In order to address these challenging queries we follow a unique path, both empirically and theoretically. Theoretically, we argue that political authority is a pivotal common denominator that undergirds diverse understandings of globalization. We then critically examine different conceptions of political authority and construct a typology that orients our study. Empirically, we follow our typology by comparing two historical phenomena: attempts by the Catholic Church to regulate the printing press during the 15th and 16th centuries, and attempts by China, Malaysia and the United States to regulate the Internet. Despite certain important commonalities, we posit that each of these cases illustrates a different model of the legitimization processes and transformations in political authority that occur under globalization",

		"description": "Herold J, Kurtz S, Giegerich R. Efficient computation of absent words in genomic sequences. BMC Bioinformatics. 2008;9(1): 167.Background: Analysis of sequence composition is a routine task in genome research. Organisms are characterized by their base composition, dinucleotide relative abundance, codon usage, and so on. Unique subsequences are markers of special interest in genome comparison, expression profiling, and genetic engineering. Relative to a random sequence of the same length, unique subsequences are overrepresented in real genomes. Shortest words absent from a genome have been addressed in two recent studies. Results: We describe a new algorithm and software for the computation of absent words. It is more efficient than previous algorithms and easier to use. It directly computes unwords without the need to specify a length estimate. Moreover, it avoids the space requirements of index structures such as suffix trees and suffix arrays. Our implementation is available as an open source package. We compute unwords of human and mouse as well as some other organisms, covering a genome size range from 109 down to 105 bp. Conclusion: The new algorithm computes absent words for the human genome in 10 minutes on standard hardware, using only 2.5 Mb of space. This enables us to perform this type of analysis not only for the largest genomes available so far, but also for the emerging pan- and meta-genome data",

		"title": "Fidelity and complexity : aspects of reality in interactive learning environments for physics learners",
		"description": "Computer-based interactive learning environments in physics can help students to differentiate between their intuitive views on natural phenomena and the formalisms of Newtonian physics. This thesis describes empirical investigations of a specific type of interactive learning environments, computer-based simulations. In many cases computer simulations deal with a simplified and idealised version of the natural phenomenon. Presenting the user with a simplification of reality is seen as one of the advantages of simulations, since too complex and too realistic simulations may sometimes be overwhelming for learners and may not permit the identification of the underlying model. Yet implications arise about the degree to which students either expect or perceive simulations to be real and how these expectations and perceptions affect their interaction with the simulation.Reality for the purposes of this research is considered to be a construct comprising the visual fidelity (fidelity) and the complexity of the underlying physical model (complexity) of the simulation. Evaluation of a number of simulations, two case studies and interviews with simulation designers and educators suggested these components. Altering the relation between fidelity and complexity levels affects students' learning and contributes to the students' perception of reality. This is demonstrated in a study of a number of simulations of the same physical phenomenon (Newtonian collisions) with degrees of fidelity and complexity which have been examined to test this hypothesis. Two empirical studies were then conducted to investigate the use of simulations which represented different fidelity and complexity levels.Analyses were carried out on videotapes and questionnaires of students interacting collaboratively with the simulations (40 hours of computer based activity). The empirical approaches to these studies, reports on work done, including the emerging data in multiple forms (questionnaires, video and audio tapes of the students interaction) and its analysis are presented in this thesis. The work reported looks at students' interaction with the simulations (pre to post test learning gain and issues concerning pre and post testing), their comments on the interface and the model underlying the simulation.The thesis supports the view that well designed computer-based simulations can promote learning and that design issues are essential to the creation of successful simulations. The findings claim that: a) enhanced fidelity of an instructional simulation has positive effects on the learner outcome,b) interfaces which use multiple representations offer valuable information which facilitates problem solving strategies andc) low complexity simulations are better suited to novice learners.These outcomes are presented as implications for simulation design and the use and development of a syntax in simulation design is also discussed (design criteria for how systems might be built). Finally the outcomes' applicability, the limitations of the studies, as well as the scope for further research that should lead to an understanding of the factors which promote successful use of simulations in the teaching of physics are presented",

		"title": "An evaluation of the initial scientific field teacher education programme in the colleges of education, Oman",
		"description": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initial teacher education programme which is specifically offered by four Omani colleges of education to prepare \"scientific field\" female teachers to teach science and mathematics subjects for pupils in Basic Education schools (Grades 1-4), ages of students from (6-10). This evaluation questions the adequacy of this programme to prepare qualified teachers to teach these subjects in a changing school system implementing a reformed Basic Education curriculum and programme. This system tends to transfer the teaching and learning process from the traditional learning environment to one that is a constructivist teaching environment. This study focuses on this programme's defined teaching competencies and to what extent the participants perceived themselves properly trained with respect to these listed competencies in their professional practices. The study also spotlights student teachers' and practicing teachers' attitudes and motivation towards the teaching profession, and towards aspects of science and mathematics teaching in primary schools. The study tried to examine the extent of the constructivist approaches by student teachers and practicing teachers in their science and mathematics lessons. The evaluation framework of the study was designed to conduct the research plan and to achieve its purposes. Several evaluation models were examined and they were critically reviewed. The review concluded that there is no one specific model which can be considered (the most) outstanding in terms of excellence, the selection of the evaluation model depends on factors such as the aim of the study, the nature of the programme, its context, and the targeted population, Thus the study constructed of three stages with findings from conducted evaluation instruments of each stage leading consequently to the next stage. In the first stage both questionnaires and semi-structured interviews are implemented. while observations with a checklist followed by follow-up interviews are conducted to gather information during the second stage. In the third stage, conversational open interviews are proceeded. Although the group focused upon for the study are the first stakeholders (the student teachers and practicing teachers), the research was extended to get information from other participants, educators from different positions, such as curriculum advisors, college lecturers, inspectors, head teachers and senior teachers. The findings from this study indicated that in general, participants' considered of the importance of the some of the listed competencies. Even though there is some consensus of the importance for these competencies, there are some un-ignorable critics who view these competencies as being far away from the goals for the preparation of scientific field teachers for the reformed Basic Education schools, most of the listed competencies are supposed to be the foundations of the programme's components, and thus the colleges of education's courses are far too general. Findings from the questionnaire show that student teachers and practicing teachers amplified their self-rating of competence in the listed competencies because responses from the face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with them found divergence views. These differing views were supported by interviewed teacher educators and principals, and their opinions towards the insufficiency of the graduates of the colleges of education. The study found from the observations of some of the practicing teachers and student teachers observed while teaching science and mathematics lessons, and from the follow-up interviews, that there is very little sign of constructivist teaching approaches used in these lessons. The study proposes recommendations which can improve and strengthen the preparation of cycle one scientific field teachers at the pre-service level and to future in-service so that teachers might better meet the range of work and responsibilities they are facing in the reformed Basic Education schools. Finally, it recommends areas for further research.EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo",

		"description": "This thesis examines the composition and behaviour of the Palestinian leadership during the peace process, from the Madrid conference in 1991 to the breakdown of Oslo in 1997. Through an historical survey, an assessment of the structure and documents of the peace process, and an analysis of the strategies of the Palestinian leadership, it demonstrates that the invitation to the peace process arrived when the Palestinian leadership in exile outside was at its weakest, simultaneously seeking to further weaken it by restricting participation in the peace talks to Palestinians from the OPT except East Jerusalem. The outside leadership decided to fall back on the strong political support and loyalty of the leadership by appointing a delegation from inside in order to avoid the political danger of exclusion and marginalization. The Palestinian delegation from inside was selected from individuals with credibility and the credentials of struggle, which meant that they were loyal to the inside's main source of power, the Palestinian public in the OPT. Thus the relationship between the inside and outside leaderships was complementary: the inside needed the legitimacy and political access of the outside, and the outside needed the unity and representation of the inside. This mutual opportunism exposed, however, each leadership's differences in structure and priorities, which stemmed from their different realities. Because its priorities and approach prevailed, the outside manipulated the inside delegation to encourage secret but direct talks between the PLO and Israel in Oslo, in parallel with the talks in Washington. The Oslo talks\u2019 lack of structure and terms of reference, the absence of a third party, as well as the missing expertise of the negotiators from the OPT, who had personal knowledge of both the Israelis and the terrain, led to weak Palestinian performance and a weak agreement. This, combined with an unfavourable environment created by Israel's expansion of illegal settlements, the asymmetry of power, and the biased position of the us mediator, led to a flawed implementation of the agreement. Among the unfortunate outcomes was the creation of a Palestinian Authority that was structurally dependent on and compromised by Israel, which thereafter affected the Palestinian leadership's implementation of subsequent agreements. Thus, the thesis concludes that a vicious cycle was created where problematic structure, delegation composition, and the leadership and delegation's behaviour led to poor process",

Along with the decentralization of responsibilities to provinces and a new structure of primary and secondary education, changes have affected the areas of curriculum design, teaching methods, teacher training, school management, and information and evaluation systems. This study describes the main policies on secondary education implemented during the last decade, including their objectives and rationales. Focusing on how the reform can be seen to relate to issues of access, quality and equity, the study presents an analysis of its implementation, and discusses some of its effects. We argue that political, economic and technical factors as well as the strategies chosen by the national government resulted in a limited implementation, and we highlight the need for considering more focused reform strategies, alternative models of teacher training, and a more active involvement of teachers",

		"title": "An evaluation of the initial scientific field teacher education programme in the colleges of education, Oman",
		"description": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the initial teacher education programme which\n\nis specifically offered by four Omani colleges of education to prepare \"scientific field\"\n\nfemale teachers to teach science and mathematics subjects for pupils in Basic Education\n\nschools (Grades 1-4), ages of students from (6-10). This evaluation questions the\n\nadequacy of this programme to prepare qualified teachers to teach these subjects in a\n\nchanging school system implementing a reformed Basic Education curriculum and\n\nprogramme. This system tends to transfer the teaching and learning process from the\n\ntraditional learning environment to one that is a constructivist teaching environment. This\n\nstudy focuses on this programme's defined teaching competencies and to what extent the\n\nparticipants perceived themselves properly trained with respect to these listed\n\ncompetencies in their professional practices. The study also spotlights student teachers'\n\nand practicing teachers' attitudes and motivation towards the teaching profession, and\n\ntowards aspects of science and mathematics teaching in primary schools. The study tried\n\nto examine the extent of the constructivist approaches by student teachers and practicing\n\nteachers in their science and mathematics lessons. The evaluation framework of the study was designed to conduct the research plan and to\n\nachieve its purposes. Several evaluation models were examined and they were critically\n\nreviewed. The review concluded that there is no one specific model which can be\n\nconsidered (the most) outstanding in terms of excellence, the selection of the evaluation\n\nmodel depends on factors such as the aim of the study, the nature of the programme, its\n\ncontext, and the targeted population, Thus the study constructed of three stages with\n\nfindings from conducted evaluation instruments of each stage leading consequently to the\n\nnext stage. In the first stage both questionnaires and semi-structured interviews are\n\nimplemented. while observations with a checklist followed by follow-up interviews are\n\nconducted to gather information during the second stage. In the third stage, conversational\n\nopen interviews are proceeded. Although the group focused upon for the study are the\n\nfirst stakeholders (the student teachers and practicing teachers), the research was extended\n\nto get information from other participants, educators from different positions, such as\n\ncurriculum advisors, college lecturers, inspectors, head teachers and senior teachers.\n\nThe findings from this study indicated that in general, participants' considered of the\n\nimportance of the some of the listed competencies. Even though there is some consensus\n\nof the importance for these competencies, there are some un-ignorable critics who view\n\nthese competencies as being far away from the goals for the preparation of scientific field teachers for the reformed Basic Education schools, most of the listed competencies are\n\nsupposed to be the foundations of the programme's components, and thus the colleges of\n\neducation's courses are far too general. Findings from the questionnaire show that student\n\nteachers and practicing teachers amplified their self-rating of competence in the listed\n\ncompetencies because responses from the face-to-face, semi-structured interviews with\n\nthem found divergence views. These differing views were supported by interviewed\n\nteacher educators and principals, and their opinions towards the insufficiency of the\n\ngraduates of the colleges of education. The study found from the observations of some of\n\nthe practicing teachers and student teachers observed while teaching science and\n\nmathematics lessons, and from the follow-up interviews, that there is very little sign of\n\nconstructivist teaching approaches used in these lessons.\n\nThe study proposes recommendations which can improve and strengthen the preparation\n\nof cycle one scientific field teachers at the pre-service level and to future in-service so\n\nthat teachers might better meet the range of work and responsibilities they are facing in\n\nthe reformed Basic Education schools. Finally, it recommends areas for further research",

		"description": "The purpose of this study was to discover and determine the elements of the parent/community culture of a comprehensive high school. More specifically, the study investigated the main elements of the parent/community culture, identified the factors contributing to that culture and their relative strengths, determined the education-related beliefs, values, and attitudes, determined how the loyal support culture was developed and maintained, and described the parent/community culture itself. The research was conducted at a comprehensive high school located in a mid-sized city in the Midwest;Interviewing was the primary method of data collection. Small group interviews were conducted with 79 participants, individual interviews were conducted with 12 participants, and informal interviews were conducted throughout 24 days spent in the field. After the interview process began, it was clear that nearly all the participants were generally positive and supportive of the school. The study was then framed through the lens of a  loyal support  culture. The beliefs, values, and attitudes were collapsed through an inductive process to provide key elements and factors of the culture;Other means of data collection included the Parent Survey: Quality of School Practices (O\\u27Connell, 1993) on the impact and quality of school practices and the level of support for the school. Additionally, an informal survey was provided to high school alumni at their annual alumni reunion banquet. The data from these two surveys provided valuable insights into the cultural elements and factors and was used in data triangulation;Results of the study determined that nine cultural elements comprised of 45 cultural factors were the foundation of this parent/community culture in relation to the high school. Of the nine cultural elements, one had a weak contribution to the parent/community culture; four had moderate contributions; three had strong contributions; and one had a very strong contribution to the parent/community culture. Of the 45 cultural factors, eleven were rated as  Weak,  eleven were rated as  Moderate,  eighteen were rated as  Strong,  and five were rated as  Very Strong.  The parent/community culture is strong, thus it helps perpetuate the educational values, beliefs, and attitudes that both help and hinder educational progress at the local high school",

Finalmente, s\u00e3o apresentados dois casos de\r\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es que sustentam a validade da tese acima mencionada.During the last decade we have witnessed a massive deployment of embedded\r\nsystems on a wide applications range, from industrial automation to process\r\ncontrol, avionics, cars or even robotics. Many of these applications have an\r\ninherently high level of criticality, having to perform tasks within tight temporal\r\nconstraints. Additionally, the configuration of such systems is often distributed,\r\nwith several computing nodes that rely on a communication infrastructure to\r\ncooperate and achieve the application global goals. Therefore, the communications\r\nare also subject to the same temporal constraints set by the application\r\nrequirements.\r\nMany applications relying on such networked embedded systems (NES)\r\nare complex and heterogeneous, comprehending different activities with different\r\nrequirements and properties. For example, the communication between\r\nsubsystems may follow a strict temporal synchronization with respect to a\r\nglobal time-base (time-triggered), like in a distributed feedback control loop,\r\nor it may be issued asynchronously upon the occurrence of events (eventtriggered).\r\nRegardless of the traffic characteristics and its activation model, it\r\nis of paramount importance having a communication framework that provides\r\nseamless integration of heterogeneous traffic sources while guaranteeing the\r\napplication requirements.\r\nAnother property that has been emerging as important for NES design and\r\noperation is flexibility. The need to reduce installation and operational costs,\r\nwhile facilitating maintenance is promoting a more rational use of the available\r\nresources at run-time, exploring the ability to tune service parameters as the\r\nsystem evolves.\r\nHowever, such operational flexibility comes with the cost of increasing the\r\ncomplexity of the system to handle the dynamic resource management, which\r\non the other hand demands the allocation of additional system resources.\r\nMoreover, the capacity to dynamically modify the system properties also\r\ncauses a higher complexity when designing and specifying the system, since\r\nthe operational state-space increases with the degrees of flexibility of the\r\nsystem.\r\nTherefore, in order to bound this complexity appropriate operational models\r\nare needed to handle the system dynamics and carry on an efficient and\r\nfair resource management strategy based on quality of service (QoS) metrics.\r\nThis thesis states that the properties of flexibility and timeliness as needed\r\nfor dynamic QoS management can be provided to switched Ethernet based\r\nsystems. Switched Ethernet, although initially designed for general purpose\r\nInternet access and file transfers, is becoming widely used in NES-based applications.\r\nHowever, COTS switched Ethernet is insufficient regarding the needs\r\nfor real-time predictability and for supporting the aforementioned properties due\r\nthe use of FIFO queues too few priority levels and for stream-level management\r\ncapabilities. In this dissertation we propose a protocol to overcome those\r\nlimitations, namely the Flexible Time-Triggered communication over Switched\r\nEthernet (FTT-SE). The protocol is based on the FTT paradigm that generically\r\ndefines a protocol architecture suitable to enforce real-time determinism on a\r\ncommunication network supporting the desired flexibility properties.\r\nThis dissertation addresses the motivation for FTT-SE, describing the\r\nprotocol as well as its schedulability analysis. It additionally covers the resource\r\ndistribution topic, where several distribution models are proposed to manage\r\nthe resource capacity among the competing services and while considering\r\nthe QoS level requirements of each service. A couple of application cases are\r\nshown that support the aforementioned thesis",

		"description": "The integration of faith and learning has been the object of study of men and women in the Canadian Calvinistic school movement ever since Dr. Abraham Kuyper pointed out that there could be no dichotomy between the sacred and the secular in the life of a Christian.  Acting on the traditions, influences and beliefs these `Reformed' Christians had imbibed in their homeland, the Dutch Calvinistic immigrants who came to British Columbia after WW II built Christian schools as soon as they arrived.  As they became more established, they formed curriculum committees of teachers who wrote curriculum for each subject area from a Christian perspective, intentionally planning to integrate their faith and learning in all subject areas.       \r\nBy looking at the history and Bible textbooks of not only the Calvinistic (Reformed) Christian day schools in British Columbia and then branching out to the history and Bible textbooks of three other denominational schools, the Mennonite, the Pentecostal and the Lutheran, I have tried to discover how the faith beliefs of each of these groups are brought to bear on the teaching of Bible.   In soliciting the strengths of each of these groups from their history, current practise and teacher comments, I have pitched my own proposal as to how the integration of faith and learning can be enhanced in the teaching of Bible. \r\nBy blending goals, curricula and best practice, as well combining certain faith belief frameworks in interpreting God's Word, by learning in community, and by listening to the Holy Spirit in the text, I believe the teaching of Bible can become `Spirited teaching'.Religious Studies and ArabicD.Th",

		"title": "On-the-Fly Constraint Mapping across Web Query Interfaces",
		"description": "Recently, the Web has been rapidly ``deepened\" with the prevalence of databases online and becomes an important frontier for data integration. On this deep Web, a significant amount of information can only be accessed as response to dynamically issued queries to the \\emph{query interface} of a back-end database, instead of by traversing static URL links. Such a query interface expresses a set of \\emph{constraint templates}, where each constraint template states how an attribute can be queried. To enable automatic query mediation among heterogenous deep Web sources, it is critical to automatically translate those constraints, which we name as \\emph{constraint mapping}. In particular, this paper aims at enabling \\emph{on-the-fly} constraint mapping, toward on-the-fly integration of Web databases, due to the the large scale and dynamic nature of the deep Web. Such on- the-fly query translation poses a significant new challenge on the generality and extensibility of the translation framework. Existing works pursue a per-source rule-driven framework and thus cannot satisfy such requirements. In contrast, we propose a generic type-based search-driven translation framework by considering the constraintmapping for each data type as a search problem. In particular, in this paper, we develop search algorithms for text and numeric types. Our experiments over real deep Web sources show that our approach is promising as a principle way to mediate queries for large scale integration",

		"description": "Thesis (Ph.D.)--Massachusetts Institute of Technology, School of Architecture and Planning, Program in Media Arts and Sciences, 2001.Includes bibliographical references (leaves 146-153).This thesis describes the processes of teacher learning and explores the associated changes that take place in classrooms. It describes the Adventures in Modeling Workshops, which we designed and created to introduce teachers to the process of conceptualizing, building, and analyzing their own models of complex, dynamic systems. The Workshops facilitate the growth of a modeling culture among teachers by giving them the tools and the ability to pose, investigate, and answer their own questions. This research examines the development, sustainability, and impact of that culture. It describes how participation in a modeling culture can contribute to a scientific way of thinking, for both teachers and their students, and can help teachers bring authentic science practice into high school classrooms. Employing technological tools developed at the Media Lab, we crafted an introduction to scientific modeling for teachers. These tools, used in concert with a constructionist pedagogy of design and creation, enable teachers to become full-fledged practitioners of modeling. Our workshop structure supports teachers as they learn to act as scientists, creating and exploring models of phenomena in the world around them, evaluating and critiquing those models, refining and validating their own mental models, and improving their understandings. This work serves as a proof of concept for a structure and methodology that increases teachers' individual capacities and helps them integrate aspects of their learning into their own classes. It examines the role that new media plays in supporting new ways of thinking and enabling explorations of new domains of knowledge. It also serves as a platform for examining the details of three components of educational change: 1) the development of technology-enabled materials and activities for teacher and student learning, 2) the construction of a scientific culture among teachers through learning about, gaining fluency with, and exploring modeling technologies, and 3) the paths toward implementation of new content and educational approaches in teachers' classrooms. The results of this project provide one benchmark for evaluating the potential that new ideas and technologies hold for facilitating lasting change in America's classrooms.Vanessa Stevens Colella.Ph.D",

		"description": "This study explored the extent to which initial teacher education and training programmes provide an adequate preparation for the needs of the primary school teachers in England and Pakistan. An integral part of this exploration was the identification of particular aspects of ITE programmes which had a significant impact in enhancing the professional development of teachers, the effectiveness of the ITE programmes and then overall quality. \r\n\r\nThe second notable feature is that this study is a comparative one. The researcher chose two countries where initial teacher training programmes were being implemented, albeit in different ways. England and Pakistan are two contrasting countries from different global regions and having different cultural and social contexts. This is not a problem for comparison because the issue is whether they provide an adequate and enriching professional preparation for beginning teachers in their respective contexts. The study also aims to explore how far the English experience has potential for development and improvement in the Pakistani initial primary teacher education programme. The issue was examined in detail in different teacher education institutions located in England and Pakistan. For this purpose the researcher used Bereday\u2018s comparative methodology to investigate the juxtaposition of these two initial teacher education programmes. The researcher hopes thereby to add to the stock of theory through the use of a cross-national study.\r\n\r\nThe study indicated to what extent the beginning teachers were adequately prepared for the demands of work and the responsibilities expected of them as perceived by the profession and other stakeholders. A number of factors were found to contribute to the perceived adequacy of the professional preparation of student teachers. An enriching curriculum together with availability and quality of physical facilities and educational resources contributed to this situation. At the same time, the support from the principal stakeholders in terms of funding and staff professional development was also cited as impacting upon the quality of pre-service teacher education provided to the beginning teachers in England and Pakistan. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this research was to investigate initial teacher education in Pakistan and England to gain insights into two initial teacher education systems with a view to improving initial teacher education in Pakistan. To achieve this aim, a cross-cultural study using a multi-method approach was adopted. This research revealed how questionable it can be to merely state what the similarities and differences really are between two initial teacher education systems. Nonetheless, it did identify some important differences as between the two initial teacher education systems, namely in terms of:\r\n\r\n- cultural differences affecting initial teacher\u2018s attitude and values;\r\n- differences in governmental vision, political will, and government policies and institutional provision;\r\n- teacher education curricula, policies and delivery;\r\n-\r\n traditional and economic disparities; and theoretical underpinning.\r\nHaving conducting this research, it is the view of the writer that it is possible for Pakistan to gain from certain aspects of the experience in England, especially in administration and quality control",

		"description": "Konflik yang berkepanjangan antara Israel dan Palestina banyak\n\nmengundang perhatian masyarakat internasional. Perserikatan Bangsa-Bangsa\n\n(PBB) sebagai organisasi internasional yang membawahi negara-negara di dunia\n\njuga tidak mampu memberikan keputusan yang baik terhadap konflik tersebut.\n\nHal ini dikarenakan adanya intimidasi dari negara-negara barat. Beberapa\n\nperjanjian internasional dibentuk guna meyelesaikan konflik yang\n\nberkepanjangan antara Palestina dan Israel. Namun, seringkali Israel melakukan\n\ntindakan-tindakan pelanggaran terhadap perjanjian internasional yang telah\n\ndisepakati kedua belah pihak dalam kurun waktu 1993-2007.

		"description": "The research presented in this thesis is a case study analysis of outcomes-based assessment in Grade 9 Human and Social Sciences of Curriculum 2005 in two South African schools. The research consists of two parts: Phase One, 2002 to 2003, was a qualitative case study, interpretive in orientation and using ethnographic techniques, aimed at understanding teachers\u2019 responses to curriculum policy and the role of a school-based intervention, located within critically reflexive practice, in supporting change. During this phase, I was a co-participant operating from an insider position. During Phase Two, 2004-2005, I withdrew from the schools and took up an outsider position in order to analyse and theorise the case study. The findings of the interpretive review revealed a fascinating process of change, with some unexpected results that I lacked the theoretical and methodological tools to process. With support from critical friends, I realised that a dynamic and social process of knowledge recontextualisation had taken place, and that the research had moved beyond its initial goals. Not wishing to compromise my integrity as a qualitative researcher, I changed direction and made use of Basil Bernstein\u2019s theorising (1990, 1996) to arrive at a suitable vantage point for the analysis. The main contention of this thesis is that the new OBE curriculum framework offers exciting opportunities for teacher participation in curriculum processes. However, if teachers are to maximise these and become agents of change, they need to acquire the rules of recontextualisation and reposition themselves in the recontextualising field. This implies epistemological empowerment, which takes time and mediation but which can be achieved through an approach to teacher professional development located in critically reflexive practice",

		"description": "INTRODUCTION: Literature suggests that a diverse body of healthcare graduates could extend health service delivery. However, the\r\nliterature also indicates that the throughput of minority, working class, and historically disadvantaged students is problematic. Poor\r\nthroughput is attributed to the way that university environments alienate some students. This brief communication highlights\r\nlessons learned from exploratory interviews with four first-year oral hygiene students at a university in South Africa. It provides\r\ninsight into the issues that contribute to academic success and failure.\r\nMETHODS: Semi-structured, individual interviews, to gain information regarding students\u2019 university academic experiences were\r\nconducted. Enablers and barriers to learning identified in the literature were used to capture themes.\r\nFINDINGS: The following three themes emerged: educational identity, language and finances. The analysis showed how a white\r\nmiddle class student recognized practices that are rewarded at university and how three, working-class, black students experienced\r\ntension between their expectations and experiences and the university culture. However, far from being victims, these students\r\nprovided suggestions on how their transition might be facilitated.\r\nCONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that these students wanted both to be apprenticed into the new way of doing things while having\r\ntheir differences acknowledged. A model for education that initiates learners and also challenges the culture of power is suggested",

States are responsible for implementing, overseeing, and evaluating the SES programs; currently, several states and large local school districts have performed evaluations, with many more in the process of publishing results from statewide SES studies. Although state and district-level provider evaluations have measured SES provider effects on student achievement, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of overall program effects across states, and there is little information that relates provider characteristics to variation in student achievement outcomes. The proposed study will synthesize provider effects reported in the extant body of SES provider evaluations to generate an estimate of the overall effectiveness of the SES policy in terms of improving student achievement, and will seek to identify provider characteristics that are associated with variation in student achievement effects using a fixed effects model",

		"description": "The system B+ is the minimal positive relevant logic. B+ is trivially extended to B+T on adding a greatest truth (Church constant) T. If we leave \u2228 out of the formation apparatus, we get the fragment B\u2227T. It is known that the set of ALL B\u2227T theories provides a good model for the combinators CL at Level-I, which is the theory level. Restoring \u2228 to get back B+T was not previously fruitful at Level-I, because the set of all B+T theories is NOT a model of CL. It was to be expected from semantic completeness arguments for relevant logics that basic combinator laws would hold when restricted to PRIME B+T theories. Overcoming some previous difficulties, we show that this is the case, at Level I. But this does not form a model for CL. This paper also looks for corresponding results at Level-II, where we deal with sets of theories that we call propositions. We adapt work by Ghilezan to note that at Level-II also there is a model of CL in B\u2227T propositions. However, the corresponding result for B+T propositions extends smoothly to Level-II only in part. Specifically, only some of the basic combinator laws are proved here. We accordingly leave some work for the reader.&nbsp",

		"description": "This study addresses the phenomenon of elite Islamic schools in Indonesia by focusing on Al Azhar Islamic High School in Jakarta. Taking as its starting point the evolution and expansion of Islamic educational institutions in contemporary Indonesia, particularly since the 1970s, it examines the emergence of elite Islamic schools and identifies the unique characteristics that attract many urban, middle-class Muslims to send their children to these schools. In addition, this study attempts to address the lack of research on the history of Islamic education in Indonesia between the years 1970 and 2000. A review of past studies demonstrates that this period has not been critically examined enough.In looking at the specific example of Al Azhar Islamic High School, an evaluative case study and ethnographic techniques were employed. Interviews, observations, and fieldnotes served as primary resources. As the first elite Islamic school ever founded, it has distinguished itself as a pioneer in providing educational service especially to the urban Muslim society in Jakarta. My central research question was whether the changes that had occurred in the Islamic educational system following the introduction of elite or excellence-oriented schools had really lived up to expectations. More specifically, I inquired into the strengths and weaknesses of elite Islamic schools faced with the task of meeting ongoing and complex challenges in this era of globalization, while at the same time maintaining Islamic teachings and practices.However, this study found that there is still a gap between the ideals of the elite Islamic school and its ability to pursue its stated goals of education. The lack of human resources and poor communications between school community and government show that these schools have not yet achieved the highest quality standards. The study also reveals that the school has to adopt policies to promote transparency in the organizational and administrative spheres, openness to non-Muslims, and accessibility to other sections of society.This research makes a contribution to the fields of school reform and school effectiveness. Moreover, the study may also have implications for other social and religious contexts",

		"description": "The purpose of this case study was to understand governance of higher education in the developing country of Belize by examining how governance affects financial and curricular decision-making in higher education in Belize. The study also examined the role of the market in higher education and its effects on curricular and financial decision-making in higher education. Data were collected from higher education administrators and Ministry of Education officials through semi-structured interviews, and from review of institutional and public documents related to higher education. A major finding of this study is that although the Ministry of Education through the Tertiary and Post Secondary Services Unit is responsible for the supervision and development of the higher education system, there is a lack of expertise in this  Unit .\nThe lack of expertise means that there is no one who can advise the Ministry of Education in respect to the direction or development of higher education. The study also revealed that there is a lack of an adequate funding formula to support the University of Belize and the junior colleges. While the junior colleges receive only salary grants, UB receives a yearly subvention for capital and recurring expenditures. The lack of a funding formula to include capital projects stifles the infrastructural development of the institution and affects the quality of education offered. The study also revealed that there is a lack of a national development plan to assist institutions in identifying academic programs that meet national development needs. As a result, academic programs are often identified based on market needs, perceived community needs, and social and religious needs depending on the religious affiliation of the institution.\nAnother finding of the study is the role of the market in higher education in Belize. The market plays or should play a role in guiding higher education in Belize, but there is a need for policies and measures to be instituted to lessen the effects of the market. Also, while competition among institutions is necessary because of the small size of the higher education system, collaboration is even more crucial",

		"title": "Implementation of gaussian process models for non-linear system identification",
		"description": "This thesis is concerned with investigating the use of Gaussian Process (GP) models for the identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. The Gaussian Process model is a non-parametric approach to system identification where the model of the underlying system is to be identified through the application of Bayesian analysis to empirical data. The GP modelling approach has been proposed as an alternative to more conventional methods of system identification due to a number of attractive features. In particular, the Bayesian probabilistic framework employed by the GP model has been shown to have potential in tackling the problems found in the optimisation of complex nonlinear models such as those based on multiple model or neural network structures. Furthermore, due to this probabilistic framework, the predictions made by the GP model are probability distributions composed of mean and variance components. This is in contrast to more conventional methods where a predictive point estimate is typically the output of the model. This additional variance component of the model output has been shown to be of potential use in model-predictive or adaptive control implementations. A further property that is of potential interest to those working on system identification problems is that the GP model has been shown to be particularly effective in identifying models from sparse datasets. Therefore, the GP model has been proposed for the identification of models in off-equilibrium regions of operating space, where more established methods might struggle due to a lack of data.\n\nThe majority of the existing research into modelling with GPs has concentrated on detailing the mathematical methodology and theoretical possibilities of the approach. Furthermore, much of this research has focused on the application of the method toward statistics and machine learning problems. This thesis investigates the use of the GP model for identifying nonlinear dynamic systems from an engineering perspective. In particular, it is the implementation aspects of the GP model that are the main focus of this work. Due to its non-parametric nature, the GP model may also be considered a \u2018black-box\u2019 method as the identification process relies almost exclusively on empirical data, and not on prior knowledge of the system. As a result, the methods used to collect and process this data are of great importance, and the experimental design and data pre-processing aspects of the system identification procedure are investigated in detail. Therefore, in the research presented here the inclusion of prior system knowledge into the overall modelling procedure is shown to be an invaluable asset in improving the overall performance of the GP model. \n\nIn previous research, the computational implementation of the GP modelling approach has been shown to become problematic for applications where the size of training dataset is large (i.e. one thousand or more points). This is due to the requirement in the GP modelling approach for repeated inversion of a covariance matrix whose size is dictated by the number of points included in the training dataset. Therefore, in order to maintain the computational viability of the approach, a number of different strategies have been proposed to lessen the computational burden. Many of these methods seek to make the covariance matrix sparse through the selection of a subset of existing training data. However, instead of operating on an existing training dataset, in this thesis an alternative approach is proposed where the training dataset is specifically designed to be as small as possible whilst still containing as much information. In order to achieve this goal of improving the \u2018efficiency\u2019 of the training dataset, the basis of the experimental design involves adopting a more deterministic approach to exciting the system, rather than the more common random excitation approach used for the identification of black-box models. This strategy is made possible through the active use of prior knowledge of the system.\n\nThe implementation of the GP modelling approach has been demonstrated on a range of simulated and real-world examples. The simulated examples investigated include both static and dynamic systems. The GP model is then applied to two laboratory-scale nonlinear systems: a Coupled Tanks system where the volume of liquid in the second tank must be predicted, and a Heat Transfer system where the temperature of the airflow along a tube must be predicted. Further extensions to the GP model are also investigated including the propagation of uncertainty from one prediction to the next, the application of sparse matrix methods, and also the use of derivative observations. A feature of the application of GP modelling approach to nonlinear system identification problems is the reliance on the squared exponential covariance function. In this thesis the benefits and limitations of this particular covariance function are made clear, and the use of alternative covariance functions and \u2018mixed-model\u2019 implementations is also discussed",

		"title": "Validation of the physical activity index (PAI) as a measure of total activity load and total kilocalorie expenditure during submaximal treadmill walking",
		"description": "PURPOSE: The primary purposes of this investigation were to examine the validity of the Physical Activity Index (PAI) as, (a) a measure of total activity load (intensity of exercise x volume of exercise) and (b) as an estimate of total kilocalorie (kcal) expenditure during submaximal treadmill walking. A secondary purpose was to compare estimated kcal expenditure determined by the PAI prediction model to the estimated kcal expenditure determined by the SenseWear Pro Armband\u2122. METHODS: Thirty-two recreationally active females (20.36 \u00b1 1.27 years) participated in this study. Subjects participated in three counterbalanced submaximal walking bouts: low intensity (4.02 km\u22c5hr\u207b\u00b9, 0% grade), moderate intensity (5.63 km\u22c5hr\u207b\u00b9, 2.5% grade), and high intensity (7.24 km\u22c5hr\u207b\u00b9, 5% grade). Each bout was separated by five min of rest. During each of the three exercise bouts, oxygen consumption (VO\u2082), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), pedometer step count, and kcal expenditure were measured. The PAI was calculated as the product of RPE and pedometer step count for each of the three, 10 minute bouts of treadmill walking. RESULTS: Concurrent validation of the PAI was established using VO\u2082 and heart rate (HR) as the criterion variables. Multiple regression analyses revealed a strong, positive relation between PAI score and VO\u2082 (r = 0.92) and HR (r = 0.84). Data were then used to develop a statistical model to estimate kcal expenditure using the PAI score as the predictor variable. Walking kcal expenditure predicted by Model III was highly correlated with measured kcal expenditure (r = 0.85). Similarly, kcal expenditure estimated by the SenseWear Pro Armband\u2122 evidenced a strong, positive correlation with measured kcal expenditure (r = 0.83) when calculated across the three walking intensities. CONCLUSION: The development of a PAI using RPE and pedometer step count to estimate kcal expenditure may have significant public health implications. The PAI was found to be more accurate then the Armband method of estimating kcal expenditure and is a simple, unobtrusive and inexpensive tool which may be used to assess kcal expenditure in public health, clinical, and/or rehabilitation settings",

		"title": "The role of integrated quality management system to measure and improve teaching and learning in South African further education and training sector",
		"description": "Since 1994, South African education system has been undergoing continuous transformation which had an impact on the quality of teaching and learning. There appeared to be a huge underperformance in the High School and FET College learners which for many years forced Universities to embark on bridging courses in order to enroll new students. Furthermore, a misalignment of college\u2019s National Technical Diploma (NATED) programmes that did not afford college graduates an opportunity to register with Universities nor Universities of Technology brought about the questioning of the quality of teaching and learning in the FET College sector. Tabling the unified quality improvement plans in education in South Africa, the Education Ministry introduced an integrated approach to measure teaching and learning with the view of identifying improvement strategies. However, the implementation of this integrated tool called the Integrated Quality Management System had educators and managers attaching ambiguous meanings to the system. The IQMS instrument is meant to be a dependable quality assurance tool to measure and improve the quality of teaching and learning. The ambiguity lies with educators and managers referring to IQMS as a means to acquire 1% pay progression and the possible return of the old apartheid systems\u2019 inspectorate. This research study was promulgated by a concern on the effectiveness and efficiency of implementing the IQMS instrument to measure the quality of teaching and learning in South African FET sector. In exploring literature on the concept of quality teaching and learning in the FET sector in South Africa, the researcher identified that similar trends of integrating quality management systems in education are being followed globally. The difference to the South African system is the attachment of the salary progression of 1% as an incentive to performance. In view of the \r\nintroduction of the new system of education and training, the researcher realized that \u2018short cut\u2019 processes were followed in preparing educators to be able to offer new education programmes using the OBE system of teaching and learning. That appeared to be another shortfall to the adequacy of implementing IQMS as a quality assurance instrument to measure the quality of teaching and learning in the FET sector in South Africa.\r\nIn addition, there appeared to be conflicting trends in the FET sector where the same sector provided curriculum 2005 programmes for schools which differed from college programmes offering National Certificate Vocational {NC(V)}. Both sectors were expected to use IQMS as a tool to measure the quality of teaching and learning with the view of enhancing improvement thereof. Furthermore, the end product of the FET sector for both schools and colleges is the Further Education and Training Certificate (FETC). Unfortunately, it was difficult for the education department to achieve its objectives because time frames to prepare educators and the critical element of providing adequate human resources for the implementation of IQMS could not be met through Umalusi the national quality assurance body for the sector.\r\nThe FET Sector which is expected to deliver Education and Training to produce quality students for HE sector and the world of work is faced with shortfalls of quality delivery. The driving force of this research study was to explore the dependability and adequacy of implementing IQMS as a quality assurance instrument to effectively and efficiently measure the quality of teaching and learning to meet the expected outcomes. It is in this regard that the researcher through empirical evidence realized that IQMS did not have theoretical grounding hence there are no principles, procedures or processes that govern the implementation of this very important system.\r\nIn addition, the empirical evidence from the qualitative study proved that quality delivery of teaching and learning has been monitored using diverse assessment practices. A variety of assessment tools like the TQM and QMS which exist in FET Colleges with the summative IQMS in FET Schools of which the three practices are premised around Quality Management. Quality Management refers to a process where quality delivery in a school, college or any other organization is systematically managed to maintain the competence of the organization. It is in this regard that TQM, QMS and IQMS refer to Quality Assurance Practices in any organization that is geared to effective and efficient client relations.Teacher EducationD.Ed.

		"description": "The purpose of this study was to examine preschool teachers\\u27 verbal interactions with children during morning self-selection time. Naturalistic (Day 1) and experimental (Day 2) designs were used to provide empirical evidence of the availability of science activities and accessible science materials in preschool classrooms. The participants were 20 head teachers of 3- to 5-year-old preschoolers employed in central Iowa child care centers. Each teacher was videotaped for two consecutive days during morning self-selection time. The most frequent preschool teachers\\u27 verbal interaction for Day 1 and Day 2 combined was giving learning guidance, and they used more verbal statements than questioning statements. Teachers tend to interact with children mostly in the art area. During the pre-planned science activity, the most frequent teacher statement was giving learning guidance (M = 2.07) and the most frequent questioning, statement was closed questions (M = 1.00). On Day 2 teachers used more learning guidance and information talk statements and more attention-focusing questions as well. On Day 1, teachers used more praise and acknowledge statements and closed questions. Teachers\\u27 use of the science-related questions (i.e., attention-focusing, problem-posing, measuring and counting, comparing, and reasoning questions) was significantly related to the classroom areas. The study showed that preschool teachers tended to use more measuring and counting questions in the block and manipulative areas and used more reasoning questions in the dramatic area. These findings suggest that children\\u27s science process skills (e.g., observing, predicting, classifying, collecting, and recording data) relate to the activity settings/materials in the classrooms. Involving a science activity seemed to increase teachers\\u27 verbal interactions, both verbal and questioning statements",

		"description": "Aims: The primary aim of this randomised-controlled trial was to evaluate the effect of an exercise consultation (experimental condition) compared with standard exercise information (control condition) on maintenance of physical activity six and 12 months following completion of a phase III hospital-based exercise programme. Secondary aims included assessing the effect of an exercise consultation compared with exercise information on physiological and psychological variables at six and 12 months. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the exercise consultation was more effective than exercise information in maintaining self-reported physical activity for 12 months after completion of a phase III exercise programme. However, the change in CSA accelerometer readings over the 12-month study period did not parallel the significant decrease in self-reported physical activity observed in the control group. The exercise consultation was not effective in maintaining exercise capacity for 12 months after completion of phase III. Significant decreases in peak VO2 from baseline to 12 months were observed in both groups. In contrast, an improvement in the VO2 at the lactate threshold, which is an index of submaximal endurance capacity, was recorded in the experimental group compared to the control group from baseline to follow-up. Finally, the exercise consultation had no significant effect on processes of exercise behaviour change, lipid profile and psychological function. These variables were normal at baseline and were maintained over the study period in both groups. The results of this study demonstrate that the exercise consultation may be an effective intervention for maintaining physical activity after completion of phase III hospital-based exercise programmes. The exercise consultation is a minimal intervention that could be delivered by physiotherapists to patients at the end of phase III or by British Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation (BACR) trained exercise instructors to patients in phase IV.EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo",

		"description": "Equitable computer collaborations in mixed-gender teams have been a pressing issue for many years. While some have argued for creating single-gender teams or girls-only computer activities, our approach was different. The current study examines a three-month software design activity in which mixed teams of girls and boys (10\u00b112 year olds) designed and implemented multimedia astronomy resources for younger students. In this context we assessed gender differences in students &apos; levels of access to technology and how these participa-tion patterns changed throughout the project duration. We found through our qualitative analyses that the con\u00aeguration of social, physical and cognitive ``spaces&apos; &apos; in the project environment contributed to a positive change in girls &apos; levels of access. We discuss the implications of these results in regard to issues surrounding the development and maintenance of gender equity in computer use and further research. KEY WORDS: Gender equity; technological \u00afuency; learning through design. As recent research has shown, the road toward becoming technologically literate and scienti\u00aecally competent has been a ``leaking pipeline&apos; &apos; for girls and women in particular, from the elementary schools where girls feel disenfranchised in science and technology, to universities where fewer female students choose science and engineering majors (Camp, 1997). A variety of explanations have been offered for this trend, ranging from different attitudes toward computers (Shashaani, 1994) and different levels of participation in computer and science courses (Chen, 1985; Linn, 1985), to cultural and so-cial conditions found in the respective domain",

In researching types of schools around the world, two types of schools were generally in existence. For this study, two missionary sites were selected from Central and South America. One school in Bolivia serves as a place of education for children of missionaries as well as local people. Another school in Honduras is operated by a local church and ministers to the children of three Honduran cities. The information gathered from these schools serves as means of providing a clearer picture of what a teacher in the missionary field encounters on a daily basis. A person interested in pursuing this occupation would likely find himself in a school structured like either one of these schools, and examining the structure, foundation, beliefs, and accreditation of these schools was an essential portion of each section of the project.Honors CollegeThesis (B.?.",

Yet schools and the educational context in which they operate, offer potentially important insights into how organizations use rhetoric in their communications to persuade audiences and leverage advantage in the marketplace. This study, which utilises rhetorical analysis to examine the persuasive, yet ambiguous strategies used in 65 school prospectuses in Australia, revealed six strategies consistently used by schools to leverage competitive advantage and persuade internal and external audiences: identification, juxtapositioning, bolstering or self-promotion, partial reporting, selfexpansion and reframing or reversal. As well as illustrating how schools operate in the context of marketisation and privatization discourses in 21st century education, the organizational theory and methods utilised for the research demonstrates how rhetorical strategies draw on, as well as reproduce, socio-political and cultural discourses around economic and social privilege",

		"title": "The management of physical resources by principals in the rural secondary schools of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa",
		"description": "This research study examined whether the physical resources in rural secondary schools are adequate and are managed properly by the school principals, for quality education to be achieved in the Eastern Cape Province. The dramatic changes in South Africa recognized that the future depends on an education system which develops the full potential of all learners. Although the Constitution of South Africa is advocating for equal education for all, there are disparities which are evident in the quality of the infrastructure, especially in remote rural areas where the fundamental requirements for effective education are lacking such as, water, electricity, sanitation and basic educational equipment. This shows that, although policy and legislative frameworks for transforming the education system have been put in place, managing the change is still a key challenge especially that of physical resources. Management of physical resources illustrates the problems facing principals by pointing to the lack of basic facilities in many rural secondary schools. In terms of the provision and management, many challenges remain, like most schools do not have adequate physical facilities. School buildings such as classrooms are inadequate or unsafe with no toilets, libraries, laboratories and many learners and teachers do not have learner teaching support materials (LTSMs). On the other hand, in terms of the Constitution, the Department of Education is responsible for bringing redress, equality and to upholding the Constitutional values such as shared decision-making, transparency, shared accountability and empowerment for equal partnership with other stakeholders. The physical resource management is one of the major responsibilities of principals. Their leadership is largely about ensuring that a clear and shared sense of direction is developed for both leadership and management. The school viii system meant that schools have moved nearer to the communities they serve and this has led to schools being more accountable to their communities. This study further investigated whether there is a significant correlation between the management of physical resources and quality education as well as the eradication of poverty in the rural secondary schools of the ECP. The proper execution of the management tasks of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling (POLC) by the principals have contributed extensively to the success of the schools. Therefore, this will mean that the act of managing physical resources through POLC and the process of working with or through SGBs, teachers, parents, learners, EDOs and the community at large to achieve set goals of education of relevance, excellence and quality education by effectively and efficiently using the physical resources in a school climate and environment that is collegial. The study showed that there is a link between management tasks (POLC) and collegial style of leadership in the school. The literature reviewed supported the view that the invitational style of leadership and collegiality increase the potential of a school to manage its physical resources economically, efficiently and effectively, particularly in a climate where the resource handlers take ownership of the school especially in remote rural settings. The 255 out of 300 subjects (85%) chosen to participate in this study were selected on the basis of their accessibility. Convenience sampling was used to conduct the study as this ensured that the population represented stakeholders that manage physical resources at schools, such as deputy principals, head of departments and teachers. Questionnaires were distributed, completed and collected personally. The questionnaires were analyzed and gaps such as the effects of lack of physical resources and how the learners\u2019 profile were affected were reinforced by individual and group interviews that were semi-structured as ix well as participant observations from principals at O.R Tambo, Chris Hani and Amathole District Municipalities were conducted. It was deduced from the statistical data presented that there is a significant correlation between the principals\u2019 management tasks and the quality of education. This shows that the more the principals blend properly planning, organizing, leading and control management tasks the more the physical resources will be managed better, that is, effectively, efficiently, economically and transparently and the less the bringing together of management tasks the less the meaningful management of physical resources will be. The study supported the hypothesis that a combination of management tasks performed by the principals positively influences the proper management of physical resources in rural secondary schools of ECP. The study rejects both null hypotheses that there is no significant correlation between planning, organising, leading and controlling as leadership functions of PRs and the quality of education in rural secondary schools of ECP as well as, that principals of rural secondary schools are not expected to possess adequate leadership knowledge and skills to effectively manage available PRs in their rural secondary schools. This study affirms the view that adequate physical resources are crucial as well as the appropriate management skills of principals for high quality education to be achieved in rural secondary schools. Without adequate physical resources, proper handling of the limited physical resources and the possession of management skills by principals, rural schools are less likely to succeed in their efforts to improve education",

		"title": "Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP)",
		"description": "In this paper, the concept of environmental indicator is reviewed as a relevant element used in the environmental management of any organisation. The importance of this element within an Environmental Management System (EMS) is also justified. Although EMS standards recognise the relevance of using indicators, they do not specify any methodology to identify which indicators have to be implemented. In addition, the present research demonstrates that although there is a high percentage of European ports that have already implemented performance indicators, most of them do not mention the method applied to obtain the indicators. This suggests that some of the procedures used by ports to identify indicators may not necessarily be science-based or systematic in approach. For these reasons, the need to develop a new methodology able to identify the ports' most adequate indicators was detected. Therefore, a Tool for the identification and implementation of Environmental Indicators in Ports (TEIP) was developed. It aims at identifying performance indicators in ports and providing guidelines for their proper implementation. This is a computer and science-based tool (www.eports.cat/teip) that provides a quick calculation and outputs, and it is designed to be as user-friendly and practical as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user. This new methodology is applicable to all types of ports no matter the size, geographical location or its commercial profile; it provides targeted and specific results for each one. TEIP aims at helping port managers at easily determining their significant port indicators, which provides valuable elements for the decision-making processes.Peer Reviewe",

		"title": "Dmodel and Dalgebra : a data model and algebra for office documents",
		"description": "This dissertation presents a data model (called D_model) and an algebra (called D_ algebra) for office documents. The data model adopts a very natural view of modeling office documents. Documents are grouped into classes; each class is characterized by a  frame template , which describes the properties (or attributes) for the class of documents. A frame template is instantiated by providing it with values to form a  frame instance  which becomes the synopsis of the document of the class associated with the frame template. Different frame instances can be grouped into a folder. Therefore, a folder is a set of frame instances which need not be over the same frame template.\nThe D_model is a dual model which describes documents using two hierarchies: a document type hierarchy which depicts the structural organization of the documents and a folder organization, which represents the user\\u27s real-world document filing system. The document type hierarchy exploits structural commonalities between frame templates. Such a hierarchy helps classify various documents. The folder organization mimics the user\\u27s real-world document filing system and provides the user with an intuitively clear view of the filing system. This facilitates document retrieval activities.\nThe D_algebra includes a family of operators which together comprise the fundamental query language for the D_model. The algebra provides operators that can be applied to folders which contain frame instances of different types. It has more expressive power than the relational algebra. It extends the classical relational algebra by associating attributes with types, and supporting attribute inheritance. Aggregate operators which can be applied to different frame instances in a folder are also provided. The proposed algebra is used as a sound basis to express the semantics of a high level query language for a document processing system, called TEXPROS.\nIn the model, frame instances can represent incomplete information. Null values of the form value at present unknown are used to denote missing information in some fields of the incomplete frame instances. This dissertation provides a proof-theoretic characterization of the data model and defines the semantics of the null values within the proof-theoretic paradigm",

But if the quality of leadership matters, then understanding what motivates individuals to become politicians and perform competently in office becomes a central question. In this paper, we examine whether higher wages attract better quality politicians and improve political performance using exogenous variation in the salaries of local legislators across Brazil\u2019s municipal governments. The analysis exploits discontinuities in wages across municipalities induced by a constitutional amendment defining caps on the salary of local legislatures according to municipal population. Our main findings show that higher wages increases political competition and improves the quality of legislators, as measured by education, type of previous profession, and political experience in office. In addition to this positive selection, we find that wages also affect politicians\u2019 performance, which is consistent with a behavioral response to a higher value of holding office.",

		"title": "Construction of interfaces for the transfer of data between geographical information systems",
		"description": "This thesis deals with the problem of constructing the interfaces needed to transfer data between different geographical information systems.\r\n Traditionally, data values were moved from one computer system to another using magnetic tapes and, more recently, using CD-ROM. Use of communication networks to move data sets from one computer system to another greatly widens the scope for data transfers. Examples of types of data transfer now possible are: the development of federated and distributed database management systems which allow data to be transferred among databases stored on different computer systems; the use of electronic mail servers for the distribution of data files; use of hand-held data collectors that can transfer field data through communication links; and applications which, though executing on separate computer systems, communicate with each other through a network.\r\n The diverse data representations defined for different geographical information systems cause difficulties when attempting to transfer geographical data. To better understand these representations, and thereby assist in the construction of interfaces, the representation of geographical data values is discussed using the concepts of: an abstraction, which is a collection of ideas about the data to be represented; a data model, which defines a notation for describing the types of data values, and operations for manipulating these values; and a schema, which is a definition of an abstraction using the notation and operations defined by a data model.\r\n The author's approach to interface construction is based on generating interfaces from formal transfer specifications. Any such specification defines: the various representations to which the data conforms before, during, and after the transfer; the transformations to modify the data values from one representation to another; and perhaps also transformations to move the values between different computer systems.\r\n An interface can be generated from such a transfer specification using the software tool a2b, which has been developed by the author as part of this project. An interface is defined as comprising some combination of four types of interface modules. Decoder modules transform data values from a text-file representation into a memory-resident representation, and encoder modules perform the reverse transformation. Translator modules modify the types of data values, and communication modules send and receive data values through a communications network. These modules are either generated directly by a2b, or from specifications generated by a2b and processed by other software tools such as bison, flex, and the software tools rosy and pepsy provided within the ISO Development Environment (ISODE)",

		"title": "Voices of three African American female college presidents: A qualitative study of their journeys",
		"description": "There are many prevailing myths that have influenced society\\u27s perception of Black women. As a result, a tradition of negativity surrounds African American women in American society. It is these  negative perceptions and misinterpretation of African American women\\u27s behavior that found its way into colleges and universities  (Myers, 1991, p. 9). Unlike White women, and Black men, Black women in academe experience double jeopardy; race and gender biases (Gregory, 1995; Myers, 2002). Research on Black women has found that they are concentrated at the lowest academic ranks, non-tenured, paid less than their male and White female counterparts, and promoted at slower rates, marginalized, viewed as tokens, isolated, expected to work harder, and generally lack mentorship and collegiality (Moses, 1997). Despite these obstacles, a number of Black women succeeded to become university and college presidents; The purpose of this research was to explore the journeys of three African American women college and university presidents through their history, educational preparation, career paths, and experiences. In addition, the expectation was to identify perceptions of barriers, strategies, and leadership characteristics employed to acquire the position of\\u27 president. This study specifically addressed questions regarding their perceptions of challenges, how these challenges were overcome, and how those challenges shaped their leadership style. Exploration of these areas through observations, qualitative interviews, and document collection provided the researcher with valuable information that contributed to the extant research on African American women in leadership positions; The analysis and interpretation of the data was made through the phenomenological method of horizontalization, categorization, and textural and structural descriptions (Creswell, 1998; Merriam, 1998; Tesch, 1990; Spiegelberg, 1965; Moustakas, 1994). Using that methodology, seven themes were identified: family background, the communities where they grew up, segregation, Black identity development, educational experiences, professional pathway, and leadership style; The three participants in this study attributed their success to strong family backgrounds, growing up in Black communities, the Black church, and attending predominately Black schools which fostered their Black identity, strong sense of self; self-esteem, resiliency, motivation and determination to succeed. They found through resiliency and determination creative strategies to manage the obstacles they encountered as they journeyed to the presidency. While they each took various pathways to the presidency, they generally practiced transformational leadership styles",

		"description": "Furries are a fandom that has been developing away from the public eye and yet has appeared in a negative way in many media representations. So private are many Furry communities that many people would not know what a furry was if you were to ask them. Although definition can vary, to be a Furry, a person identifies with an animal as part of their personality; this can be on a mystical/religious level or a psychological level. Some Furries see themselves as being something other than wholly human with a personality which encompasses both animal and human traits. This is not entirely a new concept as many cultures such as Indigenous Australians and Native Americans and others engage some form of animal identity, and in both English and Japanese folklore, there are tales of people who really are animals. However, in modern Western society having a spirit animal or animal identity can sometimes be framed by others as social deviance rather than religious or totemic diversity.\n\nThis thesis investigates how Furries use the online space to create a \u2018Furry identity\u2019. This thesis argues that for highly identified Furries, posthumanism is an appropriate framework to use. For less identified Furries, who are more akin to fans, fan studies literature is used to conceptualise their identity construction. This thesis addresses how stigmatization has affected their identity construction and how intra-fandom stigmatization has caused tension within the fandom between different members.\n\nThe data for this thesis was collected using mixed methods via a questionnaire online which received over a thousand responses from Furries in the online Reddit community. The data was evaluated using posthuman philosophy using theorists such as Deleuze, Guattari and Haraway. This project argues that the Furries are not a homogenous group and with varying levels of identification within the fandom. The purpose of this project is to show that negative media representations of the Furry Fandom have wrongly pathologized the Furries as deviants as opposed to fans",

		"title": "Logical-Linguistic Model and Experiments in Document Retrieval",
		"description": "Conventional document retrieval systems have relied on the extensive use of the keyword approach with statistical parameters in their implementations. Now, it seems that such an approach has reached its upper limit of retrieval effectiveness, and therefore, new approaches should be investigated for the development of future systems. With current advances in hardware, programming languages and techniques, natural language processing and understanding, and generally, in the field of artificial intelligence, there are now attempts being made to include linguistic processing into document retrieval systems. Few attempts have been made to include parsing or syntactic analysis into document retrieval systems, and the results reported show some improvements in the level of retrieval effectiveness. The first part of this thesis sets out to investigate further the use of linguistic processing by including translation, instead of only parsing, into a document retrieval system. The translation process implemented is based on unification categorial grammar and uses C-Prolog as the building tool. It is used as the main part of the indexing process of documents and queries into a knowledge base predicate representation. Instead of using the vector space model to represent documents and queries, we have used a kind of knowledge base model which we call logical-linguistic model. A development of a robust parser-translator to perform the translation is discussed in detail in the thesis. A method of dealing with ambiguity is also incorporated in the parser-translator implementation. The retrieval process of this model is based on a logical implication process implemented in C-Prolog. In order to handle uncertainty in evaluating similarity values between documents and queries, meta level constructs are built upon the C-Prolog system. A logical meta language, called UNIL (UNcertain Implication Language), is proposed for controlling the implication process. Using UNIL, one can write a set of implication rules and thesaurus to define the matching function of a particular retrieval strategy. Thus, we have demonstrated and implemented the matching operation between a document and a query as an inference using unification. An inference from a document to a query is done in the context of global information represented by the implication rules and the thesaurus. A set of well structured experiments is performed with various retrieval strategies on a test collection of documents and queries in order to evaluate the performance of the system. The results obtained are analysed and discussed. The second part of the thesis sets out to implement and evaluate the imaging retrieval strategy as originally defined by van Rijsbergen. The imaging retrieval is implemented as a relevance feedback retrieval with nearest neighbour information which is defined as follows. One of the best retrieval strategies from the earlier experiments is chosen to perform the initial ranking of the documents, and a few top ranked documents will be retrieved and identified as relevant or not by the user. From this set of retrieved and relevant documents, we can obtain all other unretrieved documents which have any of the retrieved and relevant documents as their nearest neighbour. These unretrieved documents have the potential of also being relevant since they are 'close' to the retrieved and relevant ones, and thus their initial similarity values to the query will be updated according to their distances from their nearest neighbours. From the updated similarity values, a new ranking of documents can be obtained and evaluated. A few sets of experiments using imaging retrieval strategy are performed for the following objectives: to search for an appropriate updating function in order to produce a new ranking of documents, to determine an appropriate nearest neighbour set, to find the relationship of the retrieval effectiveness to the size of the documents shown to the user for relevance judgement, and lastly, to find the effectiveness of a multi-stage imaging retrieval. The results obtained are analysed and discussed. Generally, the thesis sets out to define the logical-linguistic model in document retrieval and demonstrates it by building an experimental system which will be referred to as SILOL (a Simple Logical-linguistic document retrieval system). A set of retrieval strategies will be experimented with and the results obtained will be analysed and discussed",

What is the relationship between the syllabus wordlist and the vocabulary presented in the textbooks?\n\n\n\n3. What is the relationship between the words prescribed in the syllabus and the vocabulary presented in the classroom?\n\n\n\n4. What is vocabulary instruction in China like?\n\n\n\n5. Do the classrooms for English major university students provide a suitably rich lexical environment?\n\n\n\nIn order to identify the number and types of words available for teaching and learning, my analysis involved an in-depth examination of the syllabus word lists and textbook word lists, cross-referenced to other ESL word lists. It was found that the vocabulary requirements in the syllabus and textbooks posed enormous demands on teachers in terms of the quantity of words to be covered. University students when they graduate should know 95% of the GSL and 83% of the AWL, but this only covers about half the total amount of English vocabulary input from the syllabus and the textbooks. They are exposed to many of the \"other\" words in print. In the classroom, teachers were found to teach a new word explicitly every 2.6 minutes, using vocabulary treatment methods in accordance with the culture of teaching and learning in Chinese contexts. It was found, however, that the teachers' oral input failed to provide a lexically rich environment for incidental vocabulary acquisition and that the words available from teacher talk were limited in both variation and frequency range",

		"description": "Sri Lanka is a multi-cultural state comprising of four major ethnic groups speaking three languages. The \u2018Swabasha\u2019 policy requires all students to be educated in their mother tongue perpetuating ethnic segregation along linguistic divides. State owned, semi-governmental and private schools follow the National Curriculum under the Ministry for Education. In 1961, Sri Lanka banned the establishment of any new private schools in the country. Private schools as well as English medium education started during British rule were seen to evoke colonial pro-elitist sentiments and symbolize a driving force for social stratification. Since then, there has been a profusion of institutions claiming to be \u2018International Schools\u2019. These schools exist within a loophole in the legal framework, established under the \u2018Company\u2019s Act\u2019 and welcome students from all linguistic backgrounds to study in the English medium. However, by imposing high fees, these schools accentuate class-based discrimination.  Since the majority of students attending these international schools are locals, this study looks at the government concerns as well as the various stakeholder consternations via a mixed method study conducted in four contrasting case studies. It was found that opting for an international education was a privileged option open to a minority of Sri Lankans, which ascertained their competitiveness in a global society. However, although English proficiency and foreign credentials allow for a competitive edge in neo-liberal times, grounding oneself in the local culture was of paramount importance. These international schools were giving rise to a generation of Sri Lankans that had more in common with those from the countries where their pedagogical system originated rather than their local counterparts from their immediate vicinity. International schools hence need to incorporate both the local and the global if they are to truly achieve the internationalism that they take pride in",

		"title": "Transitions to U.S. Private Schools: Perceptions of Six Immigrant Elementary School Boys",
		"description": "The United States is faced with the privilege and challenge of educating immigrant children, not only in a second language and other skills, but also in the many and varied dimensions of life in this country  (London, 1990; p. 287).\nWhether these children have fled rigid dictatorial regimes or wars, whether they came to the U.S. directly or spent time in refugee camps or detention centers, whether they have little more than what they are wearing at the time, or their families have planned the migration carefully, leaving their countries of origin legally and peacefully, bringing currency and the promise of jobs with them, they have been uprooted and will surely experience some difficulty and emotional discomfort adjusting to their new surroundings (Mills, 1994).\n Many immigrants actually come to the U.S. not realizing that there are many differences between their culture of origin and that of the host country. They continue to speak their languages, observe customs and conventions, follow traditions, and maintain certain norms. By doing so, they often discover that they are ostracized by members of the dominant culture  (London, 1990; p. 289).\nThe problem examined in this study is the independent elementary school\\u27s regard for the culture and language as well as the socioeconomic reality of the immigrant male and its effect on his emotional well being.\nThe researcher believes that cultural differences, when mistakenly or improperly perceived by children or schools, may be particularly distressing and problematic for male students. Their entire concept of what it is to become men in relationship to themselves and the world may be weakened, trivialized, or even destroyed through ignorance or cruel regard for their cultural traditions and values. Even if those charged with conveying the dominant culture to these boys believe that a change in outlook might be healthy and beneficial for their students, the boys must be empowered to make changes in their lives which are compatible with family and community standards and beliefs. Schools must help immigrant males cherish and continue to participate in the culture which is theirs, and, at the same time, help them to meet the basic requirements of their new land in order to enjoy the success and happiness which their families want them to attain.\nThe researcher has chosen to study the emotional well being of elementary school aged males in independent schools in the U.S. There is no doubt that females deserve a similar study, but since the researcher has taught in a private boys\\u27 school, he has had the opportunity to observe the differences in masculine behavior between male immigrant students and those male students born in the United States. He believes that the differences in perception of what it means to be a man are often quite dissimilar between one culture and another and that difficulties in adjusting to the demands of the host culture can cause the immigrant male considerable discomfort as he makes this transition.\nThe role of the male differs according to a number of factors. For example, while women have traditionally been viewed as being subordinate in China, Chinese men have for some time had the reputation of being henpecked. In the United States, it is not uncommon for men to appear to head the family unit while the women often make most of the major family decisions (Sung, 1967).\nJapanese males are respected for their  health, character and willingness to work  (Petersen, 1978; p. 66). Historically, they possessed honest and authentic values and self-discipline, yet they allowed their families to choose their wives. They have always valued learning, and their literacy has been associated with economic progress and social characteristics and their hopes for the future. Like the Chinese and other Asian groups, the Japanese believe more in values related to the family than to the rugged individualism so highly prized in the U.S. (Petersen, 1978).\nBoys from Hispanic communities may be preoccupied with the concept of \\u27machismo\\u27. In these cultures, this concept may include bold and risky behavior - from games of chance to an acute sense of personal pride to a general disregard for rules and regulations. It views manhood as possessing short lived daring and \\u27bravado\\u27 rather than a long term appropriation of knowledge, skills, or discipline. Within an urban setting, \\u27machismo\\u27 may find its natural outlet in negative behavior in school or trouble with others in the street. Depending on the specific culture, the Hispanic child may have little regard for school or intellectual tradition. These traits, along with a fatalistic view of the future, may cause considerable disruption to schooling in the U.S. (Santoli, 1988).\nEach individual culture has its own male role. Each immigrant student will need to balance this role with the expectations placed on him by the host culture and the school he attends. This will be especially difficult if there are few if any children or adults from his culture of origin with whom to relate and confide in the new school setting (Handlin, 1962).\nThis study, therefore, investigates how a male immigrant child\\u27s culture (including his language and his instinctive sense of his own masculinity) and socioeconomic circumstances are acknowledged and accepted in independent elementary school settings, and how this reality affects his emotional well being as he transitions from home to school",

		"description": "The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Problem asks for the longest sequence of\n(non-contiguous) matches between two given strings of characters. Using\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find a finite size scaling law of the\nform E(L)/N =C + A/(N^1/2 ln N)+... for the mean LCS length of two random\nstrings of size N over S letters. We provide precise estimates of C for S\nbetween 2 and 15. We consider also a related Bernoulli Matching model where the\ndifferent entries of an N times M array are independently occupied with\nprobability 1/S. In that case we find the expression of the limit of L(N,M)/N\nas N grows to infinity, as a function of r=M/N. This expression provides a very\ngood approximation for the Random String model, which gets more and more\naccurate as S increases. The question of the ``universality class'' of the LCS\nproblem is also considered. For the Bernoulli Matching model we find very good\nagreement with recent scaling predictions of Hwa and Lassig for\nNeedleman-Wunsch sequence alignment. We find however that the variance of the\nLCS length has a different scaling different in the Random String model,\nsuggesting that long-ranged correlations among the matches are relevant in this\nmodel. We finally study the ``ground state'' properties of this problem. We\nfind in particular that the number of solutions typically grows exponentially\nwith N, i.e. this system has a residual entropy at T=0. Also the overlap\nbetween two LCSs chosen at random is found to be self averaging and to aproach\na definite value q(S)<1 as N grows.Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures. Accepted for publication in EPJ ",

This study sought to determine if this concern is prevalent in Adventist colleges in Southeast Asia. To find answers to this concern the following questions were posed.\n1. What methods do these colleges use to promote or recruit SDA students?\n2. How do these colleges attract SDA students?\n3. What special programs are in place in the colleges to retain SDA students?\nMarketing higher education has been effective in some colleges and universities in the United States. It may be of some value for Seventh-day Adventist colleges in Southeast Asia to learn from the conclusions of this study. Marketing concepts discussed here could help other SDA educational institutions in their attempts to promote, attract, and retain SDA students..\nMethod\nTwo instruments were utilized for data collection: (1) a set of structured questions to interview selected administrative staff on their marketing strategies, and (2) a survey questionnaire that required the responses of undergraduate students regarding the marketing strategies o f their college. Both the interview questions and the survey questionnaire cover three marketing strategies\u2014promotion or recruitment, attraction, and retention of Adventist students in the colleges. Responses from the staff and students were analyzed.\nResults\nThe following are the findings of this study:\n1. In all the four selected colleges in Southeast Asia some marketing activities had been carried out but they are less sophisticated or systematized than those found in the United States of America.\n2. The large number of students in countries in Southeast Asia who want to attend college suggests why marketing is not more sophisticated than those found in the United States.\n3. There are similarities and differences in the way the colleges promote, attract or retain SDA students.\nConclusion\nSeventh-day Adventists create a common \u201cculture\u201d among different peoples in the region and thus marketing techniques to promote or recruit, attract and retain SDA students tend to be similar.

We provide micro-evidence on the consequences of corruption for the quality of education. We use data from the auditing of Brazil\u2019s local governments to construct objective measures of corruption involving educational block grants transferred from the central government to municipalities. Using variation in the incidence of corruption across municipalities and controlling for students\u2019, schools\u2019 and municipal characteristics, we find that corruption significantly reduces the school performance of primary school students. Students residing in municipalities where corruption in education was detected score 0.35 standard deviations less on standardized tests, and have significantly higher dropout and failure rates. We also provide evidence on the mechanisms that link corruption and mismanagement to learning and school attainment. The results are consistent with corruption directly affecting economic growth through the reduction of human capital accumulation. JEL Codes: D73, I21, H72",

		"description": "Recent studies have emphasized the importance of the quality of politicians for good government and consequently economic performance. But if the quality of leadership matters, then understanding what motivates individuals to become politicians and perform competently in office becomes a central question. In this paper, we examine whether higher wages attract better quality politicians and improve political performance using exogenous variation in the salaries\u2019 of local legislators across Brazil\u2019s municipal governments. The analysis exploits discontinuities in wages across municipalities induced by a constitutional amendment defining caps on the salary of local legislatures according to municipal population. Our main findings show that increases in salaries not only attracts more candidates, but more educated ones. Elected officials are in turn more educated and stay in office longer. Higher salaries also increase legislative productivity as measured by the number of bills submitted and approved, and the provision of public goods.politician salary, quality, political agency",
